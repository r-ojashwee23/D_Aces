The first Elytra mission is scheduled to launch in 2024.","Formerly known as Firefly's Space Utility Vehicle, Elytra now offers a more robust vehicle line to provide rapid on-orbit solutions when and where customers need them
CEDAR PARK, Texas, Aug. 8, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Firefly Aerospace, Inc. , an end-to-end space transportation company, announced the expansion of its on-orbit services with a line of highly mobile and scalable orbital vehicles named Elytra. As the wings of a firefly, Elytra (pronounced ella-truh) offers on-orbit mobility, hosting, delivery, and servicing across cislunar space and beyond. When launched on Firefly's small- and medium-lift launch vehicles, Elytra can service the entire lifecycle of government and commercial missions.
""Elytra further expands Firefly's on-orbit services by opening access to more orbits, extending the life of each mission, and providing deorbiting services to help minimize space debris,"" said Bill Weber, CEO of Firefly Aerospace. ""Our robust vehicle line gives us a unique advantage to quickly launch, deploy, and service satellites on-orbit in response to dynamic changes in space.""
Formerly known as Firefly's Space Utility Vehicle, Elytra offers three vehicle models – Elytra Dawn, Elytra Dusk, and Elytra Dark – that travel further into space to support larger, more advanced on-orbit missions. Optimized for low Earth orbit (LEO), Elytra Dawn can be rapidly launched to support responsive hosting, rideshare, and delivery missions. Elytra Dusk offers enhanced maneuverability, power, and autonomy to provide responsive on-orbit tasking, such as relocation, space domain awareness, and deorbiting services, from LEO to geosynchronous orbit (GEO). Elytra Dark is ruggedized to serve as persistent orbital infrastructure and support transfers from LEO to lunar orbit and beyond.
""Firefly's Elytra vehicles are scalable and customizable to support each customer's unique on-orbit needs,"" said Jana Spruce, Vice President of Spacecraft at Firefly Aerospace. ""Utilizing many of the same flight-proven components from Firefly's launch vehicles and landers, Elytra supports rapid mission schedules while providing affordable access across cislunar space and beyond.""
Designed, manufactured, and tested in-house, Elytra utilizes flight-proven hardware flown on Firefly's Alpha vehicle and qualified systems common to Firefly's Blue Ghost lunar lander, including the carbon composite structures, core avionics, and propulsion systems. Elytra also utilizes the on-orbit heritage and learnings from Spaceflight's Sherpa vehicle following Firefly's recent acquisition of the company .
Firefly's first Elytra mission is scheduled to launch in 2024 aboard Firefly's Alpha vehicle. For more information about the Elytra vehicle, visit www.fireflyspace.com/elytra .

70781,09-08-2023 02:56,7723920,SEC Proposes Rules to Address Conflicts of Interest in the Use of AI by Investment Advisers and Broker-dealers,"On July 26, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or the Commission) announced proposed rules (the proposal) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Advisers Act) targeted at eliminating potential conflicts of interest associated with broker-dealers’ and investment advisers’ interactions with investors through the use of predictive data analytics (PDA) or artificial intelligence (AI). ","On July 26, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or the Commission) announced proposed rules (the proposal) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Advisers Act) targeted at eliminating potential conflicts of interest associated with broker-dealers’ and investment advisers’ interactions with investors through the use of predictive data analytics (PDA) or artificial intelligence (AI). The proposal generally requires broker-dealers and investment advisers (together, firms) to curb the use of AI technologies that place the firms’ interests above the interests of investors. Firms would still be permitted to use these tools, provided that they eliminate or neutralize the effects of any conflicts of interest. The proposal would also require firms to adopt policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to prevent a violation of the requirements set forth in the proposal.
The proposed rules set out the affirmative steps firms must take as a precursor to eliminating or neutralizing the effects of a conflict of interest. First, a firm would be required to evaluate any use of a covered technology in any “investor interaction” (as defined below) to identify whether it involves a conflict of interest, including through testing the technology. This includes the requirement that firms test and periodically retest any covered technology. “Covered technology” is defined under the proposal as “analytical, technological, or computational functions, algorithms, models, correlation matrices, or similar methods or processes that optimize for, predict, guide, forecast, or direct investment-related behavior or outcomes.” The proposal does not set out a specific means by which a firm is required to evaluate its use of covered technology, instead giving firms flexibility to adopt an approach appropriate for each technology the firm employs. The approach a firm takes must, however, identify conflicts associated with how the firm has used the technology in the past and how it could be used in the future, including the variety of scenarios in which the covered technology could be deployed.
Second, a firm would be required to determine if any identified conflict results in an investor interaction that places the interest of the firm or an associated person ahead of investors’ interests. For these purposes, an “investor interaction” is defined as engaging or communicating with an investor,[1] including by exercising discretion with respect to an investor’s account, providing information to an investor or soliciting an investor. The Commission notes that firms should consider a variety of factors and perform a facts and circumstances analysis in order to make the determination that an identified conflict needs to be remediated. The SEC notes that certain conflicts would be permissible under the proposed rules, so long as the covered technology does not place the interests of the firm ahead of those of investors. If use of a covered technology presents a conflict of interest but that conflict leads to an outcome that is equally favorable or more favorable to the investor, that conflict need not be remediated.
Third, the proposal would require a firm to eliminate or neutralize promptly the identified conflict of interest. The test for whether a firm has successfully eliminated or neutralized the effect of a conflict is whether the interaction no longer places the interests of the firm above those of investors. A firm could “eliminate” a conflict of interest by, for example, eliminating the practice that results in the conflict or removing the firm’s interest from the information considered by the covered technology. A firm need not go this far, however, and could simply take steps to neutralize the effects of a conflict by, for example, rendering the consideration of the firm-favorable information subordinate to investors’ interests. It is important to note that providing disclosure of the conflict and securing the informed consent of the investor is not sufficient.
The proposal requires that firms adopt, implement and maintain written policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the proposed rules. These policies and procedures must include (i) a written description of the process for evaluating any use or reasonably foreseeable use of a covered technology in any investor interaction and a written description of any material features of any covered technology prior to implementation or material modification; (ii) a written description of the process for determining whether any identified conflict of interest under the rules results in an investor interaction that places the interest of the firm or its associated persons ahead of the interests of the investor; (iii) a written description of the process for determining how to eliminate or neutralize the effect of any determined conflicts of interest; and (iv) a review and written documentation of such review, at least annually, of the adequacy of the policies and procedures and written descriptions described above, including the effectiveness of their implementation. Firms using covered technology in investor interactions that do not identify any conflicts of interest are still required to adopt and implement these written policies and procedures.
In addition to the above requirements, the Commission recommends firms should consider including other elements in their policies and procedures, as appropriate, such as (i) compliance reviews of relevant systems and controls, (ii) procedures that clearly designate responsibility to appropriate personnel for supervision of relevant functions and persons, (iii) processes to escalate identified instances of noncompliance to appropriate personnel for remediation, and (iv) training of relevant personnel on the policies and procedures as well as the forms of covered technology used by the firm.
Finally, the proposal amends rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 under the Exchange Act and rule 204-2 under the Advisers Act to set forth requirements for firms to maintain and preserve books and records related to the requirements of the proposed rules.
The proposed rules, including the full text of the proposal, can be found here. Interested parties may make comments on the proposal on or before 60 days after the proposal is published in the Federal Register.
[1] With respect to broker-dealers, the term “investor” includes only natural persons who receive or seek to receive services for personal, family or household purposes. As it relates to investment advisers, an “investor” includes “a client or prospective client, and any current or prospective investor in a pooled investment vehicle advised by the investment adviser.” Accordingly, the definition of “investor” as it applies to investment advisers is not limited to natural persons and would include institutional investors, for example.

70764,09-08-2023 02:51,7723900,"CoinGecko Launches Index for Crypto Tokens Alleged as SEC Securities, Valued at $91 Billion",Cryptocurrency data aggregator CoinGecko has introduced a new category that lists cryptocurrencies that have been designated as securities by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This move comes in response to the growing need for clarity in the complex regulatory landscape surrounding digital assets in the country.,"Cryptocurrency data aggregator CoinGecko has introduced a new category that lists cryptocurrencies that have been designated as securities by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This move comes in response to the growing need for clarity in the complex regulatory landscape surrounding digital assets in the country. The newly launched "" Top Alleged Securities Coins "" section on CoinGecko's platform presents a curated selection of crypto assets that have previously come under the scrutiny of the financial regulator for their potential classification as securities. These tokens are sorted based on their market capitalization, with Binance Coin (BNB) taking the lead position. Notable tokens such as Cardano ( ADA ), Solana ( SOL ), and Tron ( TRX ) follow suit in the list. CoinGecko Lists 24 Cryptocurrencies Deemed As Securities By SEC CoinGecko's spokesperson revealed that the index was meticulously assembled by compiling tokens that had been subject to SEC-related lawsuits in the past. Currently, this category consists of 24 tokens. However, it's worth noting that the SEC, in its recent lawsuits against top cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase and Binance, has identified 68 cryptocurrencies as securities; the market cap of these tokens amount to nearly 10% of the entire crypto market cap. SEC Chair Gary Gensler's assertion that ""everything other than Bitcoin"" should be regarded as a security has sparked discussions within the crypto community. If this perspective is upheld, it could potentially bring a significant portion of the approximately 25,500 cryptocurrencies listed on platforms like CoinMarketCap under SEC jurisdiction. Crypto Data Aggregators Introduce Specific Categories For Alleged “Security Tokens” Along with CoinGecko, other cryptocurrency data aggregators like CoinMarketCap have also introduced specific categories for cryptocurrencies that have been identified as securities by the SEC. This categorization system aims to facilitate easier tracking for investors, similar to how sectors are organized in traditional stock markets. These categories encompass various token types, such as Layer 1s, smart contract tokens, and stablecoins. Currently, CoinMarketCap lists 65 out of those 68 tokens designated as securities, contributing around 7% to the total cryptocurrency market capitalization.

The bill is expected to be sent to Congress within the next month or so. It has been discussed inside the administration of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva for months. ,"By Paulo Trevisani
Brazil's government has finalized a bill creating a cap-and-trade carbon market expected to help Latin America's largest economy curb greenhouse gas emissions.
The bill is expected to be sent to Congress within the next month or so. It has been discussed inside the administration of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva for months. The regulation is part of the administration's plan to achieve emissions reduction targets.
""We need resources to finance investment in environmental policies,"" said Guilherme Mello, the Finance Ministry's economic-policy secretary, who was involved in the discussions. To achieve Brazil's ecological goals, ""we need adequate financial instruments, and the carbon market is one of them.""
Mello estimates the market would take about three years to start operating after it is approved by Congress. Local media has reported that House Speaker Arthur Lira plans to focus on environmental legislation in the second half of this year.
The carbon market is meant to help Brazil meet its goal in the Paris Agreement of reducing emissions by 37%, based on 2005 levels, by 2025. By some estimates, regulated carbon trade could represent a 100-billion-Brazilian-real ($20.4 billion) market by 2030.
Mello said the proposed framework includes language allowing Brazilian carbon credits to be traded in cap-and-trade markets overseas and vice-versa. Diplomats from various countries have been discussing common standards to make international carbon trade possible, but this goal has been elusive so far.
""We had the intention to build something that could interact"" with foreign carbon markets, Mello said. ""Of course, it doesn't depend only on Brazil.""
He said the government also plans to beef up enforcement against illegal deforestation and issue debt tied to sustainability projects, among other environmental initiatives.
The carbon market is meant to be similar to those already operating in the E.U., California, China and other jurisdictions.
The Brazilian plan caps emissions at 25,000 metric tons a year per company. It would impact around 4,000 companies, including some large meatpackers, Mello said. Farms and ranches won't be subject to the regulation because of the complexities involved in measuring their emissions, according to Mello. However, Brazil's agribusiness, among the country's top exporters, is likely to be affected eventually, as the food industry is forced to curb emissions across its supply chain.
A 2023 report by Observatório do Clima, a non-profit focused on forest protection, estimated that Brazil's greenhouse emissions are growing, reinforcing calls for a cap-and-trade program. The report said that 49% of the country's emissions in 2021 came from deforestation--a process that includes tree cutting and burning, both of which release CO2 into the atmosphere--and 25% from raising cattle.
The industries that would be directly impacted by the new regulation are responsible for a smaller fraction of total emissions, but the regulation is expected to help keep forest cover from shrinking too fast.
Polluters will be allowed to offset emissions during a transition period. Officials and people involved with carbon projects expect the emissions cap to drive up investment in reforestation as a way to offset excessive pollution. Tree planting generates carbon credits because the plants suck CO2 from the air and store it for as long as they live. Brazil's vast territory, larger than the continental U.S., offers ample reforestation opportunities, experts say.
In an indication of Brazil's reforestation potential, Mombak Gestora de Recursos, a local startup created to attract private investment on tree planting in the Amazon and profit from the resulting carbon credits, has received funds from U.S.-based Bain Capital Partnership Strategies and a fund controlled by France's AXA, among other investors.
Another carbon credit supplier, Biofílica Ambipar Environment, announced last month a BRL300 million investment from British drugmaker AstraZeneca to plant 12 million trees in Brazil's most industrialized state, São Paulo, where most native forests have long been replaced by crops and pastures.
These and other projects have been thriving in the so-called voluntary markets, where companies buy credits to reduce their carbon footprint, regardless of mandatory caps. Brazil's planned regulation is expected to increase the value of carbon credits in general. Each credit equals 1 metric ton of CO2 removed from the air.
""Any tree planted in Brazil is additional,"" said Biofílica co-founder Plinio Ribeiro, using the carbon markets' jargon for actions that reduce greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere that wouldn't happen without the possibility to sell offsets. ""A carbon market is one of the tools needed to expand forest restoration.""

Let’s dig out more details on this! The InQubeta (QUBE) Advantage InQubeta has positioned itself strategically within the market, offering a distinctive model that facilitates fractional investments in AI startups.","As the crypto space teems with anticipation over a potential Bitcoin bull run, one emerging platform stands primed for an equally impressive rally. InQubeta (QUBE) , an AI investment platform stirring a buzz across the investment community, could ride this predicted wave to extraordinary heights. Let’s dig out more details on this! The InQubeta (QUBE) Advantage InQubeta has positioned itself strategically within the market, offering a distinctive model that facilitates fractional investments in AI startups. Participants can acquire reward and equity-based NFTs using QUBE tokens, thereby investing in some of the most promising AI projects in the market. As the platform continues to gain momentum, its presale stages have demonstrated a strong demand for its unique offerings, with analysts projecting a staggering 50x surge in value by 2024. The impending wave of capital could unlock substantial value for InQubeta, driving the value of QUBE tokens even higher. If the floodgates open to Bitcoin ETFs, investors will have the chance to diversify their portfolios with QUBE, a token with remarkable potential within the burgeoning AI industry. A Ripple Effect from a Potential ETF Approval The prospect of this $30 trillion wave of capital, as forecasted by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, is contingent on the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The potential scale of the influx is tied to the vast assets managed by U.S. financial advisors. These advisors, according to Balchunas, are eager to invest in Bitcoin, provided they can do so through a regulated ETF. While Bitcoin’s ETF approval is a central focus, its ripple effect could be equally consequential for emerging platforms like InQubeta. With capital set to flow into the crypto market, it could find its way to innovative platforms such as InQubeta, fuelling its predicted surge and bolstering its position within the sector. Riding the Wave of Innovation and Capital InQubeta’s innovative approach to funding AI startups through QUBE tokens has already started attracting attention within the investment community. The platform has democratized access to high-potential AI startups, which were previously the purview of venture capitalists and angel investors. The imminent influx of capital to the market could dramatically bolster InQubeta’s position in the crypto market. More investors could potentially turn their attention to QUBE tokens, drawn by the promise of fractional investment in AI startups. In turn, this could accelerate InQubeta’s growth, boosting the token’s value and fulfilling the prophecy of the platform’s presale success. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto Investment If a Bitcoin spot ETF does get the green light, the entire cryptocurrency market, including coins like QUBE, could be thrust into a new era of investment. The predicted tidal wave of capital could dramatically change the crypto investment landscape, making way for innovative and versatile platforms like InQubeta to shine. This shift would not only validate cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class but also highlight the innovative and unique investment models that platforms like InQubeta offer. InQubeta’s revolutionary approach to investment, combined with its promising presale performance, makes it an exciting prospect for the savvy investor. Amid the anticipation of the Bitcoin ETF approval, all eyes are on InQubeta as it prepares to surf this incoming wave. The burgeoning platform’s unique offerings could be the perfect launchpad for an exhilarating rally, transforming the investment landscape of the AI industry.

This milestone achievement represents another step on Binance’s ongoing efforts to get local licenses and permissions in key markets worldwide. With this, the company has approvals and registrations in 18 markets worldwide, including France, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Dubai, more than any other crypto exchange. Min Lin, Binance Head of Latin America, commented: “We are honored to be granted this license, as Binance continues to work collaboratively with regulatory agencies around the world to support global standards for the crypto and blockchain industry. This announcement comes after many months of dedication from our team to provide all information and proceed with the necessary due diligence required by the agencies, showcasing our commitment to the Salvadoran market and our users. We are grateful to the Central Reserve Bank and the National Commission of Digital Assets. Their blockchain technology adoption has created a thriving sector in El Salvador that proves security and innovation are complementary assets. Now, it joins countries around the world that have granted Binance a regulatory license.” Daniel Acosta, Binance General Manager for Colombia, Central America and Caribbean, said: “These licenses allow Binance to expand the products and services offered including options tailored to the needs of our customers in El Salvador. It is also a great opportunity to collaborate closely with government authorities to support the adoption of crypto assets in the country, foster financial inclusion, innovation and ensure customer protection.” El Salvador became the first country in the world to recognise Bitcoin as a legal tender in 2021 two years ago and approved a law regulating the issuance of other digital assets by both the state and private entities.

Home Affairs will now oversee protective security policy.Legislation that would ""enable facial biometric verification using state government data sources"" could also come to pass at the same time that legislation around digital IDs is being considered.The National Strategy for Identity Resilience was signed off by federal, state, and territory ministers in June, which said biometrics-based digital IDs that work nationally could become the norm in the country.

The FVS will expand to the government and private sector in the future partly to prevent the copies of credentials from needing to be stored. FIS, on the other hand, will only be used by national security and law enforcement for matching photos to government records.The National Driver Licence Facial Recognition Solution would support such services, which is not yet in operation due to the Identity-Matching Services Bill not being passed in 2019, when the Liberal Party was in power.Home Affairs awarded Fujitsu Australia an AU$37.6 million contract to provide managed services for the IDMS program including the Document Verification Service and Face Matching Service back in January.This follows the Digital Transformation Agency losing its digital ID program responsibilities in July. “The confusion around digital ID is crippling the ability of the private sector to plan for a whole-of-economy system,"" says Paul Fletcher, shadow minister for government services and the digital economy, in a release.

This compares with a loss of $1.69 million, or $.37, on revenue of $2.8 million for the same period a year ago.
Some portion of the drop is attributable to the plan that the company has been implementing for months. The idea is to switch from custom software development to software as a service, which is being executed now.
Executives added an
orchestration layer to its products and services, too, and they have been siphoning off resources from other sales efforts to staff the orchestration layer business. Sales, general and administrative spending was cut 37 percent between first quarter 2023 and 2022.
Trust Stamp says it expects “meaningful revenue” from this unit in fiscal 2024.
It has integrated orchestration layer products with the Driver License Data Verification System from the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators. With this done, according to the company, executives say they can build simplified ID tools for administrators.
All of that could lead to more revenue at some point, but today is not that point. Revenue fell by 84 percent in the most recent quarter compared to the first quarter of last year. Most of that drop, according to the software maker, was caused by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement contract that was terminated last year.
Q1 revenue rises for Idex
May 25, 2023 – Biometric sensor maker Idex saw its year-over-year loss narrow slightly during the first quarter, ended March 31. But its revenue rose by a third.
Idex, which makes sensors for cards and embedded devices, reported a loss of $7.2 million, or $.01 per basic and diluted share, on revenue of $1.2 million. This compares to a loss of $8.1 million, or $.01, on revenue of $989,000 for the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
Executives were able to reduce operating expenses on a quarter-to-quarter comparison. In the most recent period, the company reported $8.6 million and $8.9 million a year ago.
The market inflection point claimed in 2022, when nine biometric payment card programs using Idex sensors were launched, could be continuing this year. The company says seven
Turkish and Bangladeshi banks have committed to its sensors so far this year. Europe and the Middle East are showing “particularly strong” interest.
Mastercard
signed off on Idex’ fingerprint test assessment, which is essential to winning real estate on the finance company’s cards. Complete certification, according to the company, is expected in the second quarter this year.

Biometrics News| Commercial Applications| Facial Recognition
Draft rules for how businesses can and cannot use facial recognition are being aired in China.
The proposed rules have been written by the Cyberspace Administration, a Chinese regulator that also covers automated collection of biometrics. And they are not what most people outside the autocracy would consider bold.
There have been
reports for the last three years illustrating an increase in discomfort among Chinese citizens.
The bill addresses biometrics use by businesses. One rule would require that someone consent before they can be subjected to facial recognition,
according to reporting by the Reuters news agency.
Analysis of face biometrics to determine ethnicity or religion would be banned, the
Hong Kong Free Press reports. That would leave only the government and police markets open to the ethnicity detection systems developed by Hikvision and other domestic suppliers.
The Cyberspace
Administration is considering telling data collectors to choose non-biometric data sources whenever appropriate.
And some locations should be off limits to cameras: public bathrooms, changing rooms and hotel rooms, for example.
Hotel room doors are being equipped with facial recognition for the upcoming Asian Games in Hangzhou, and the technology has been used to prevent toilet paper theft for years.
Where cameras with face biometrics do go up in public spaces, it should be for public safety and prominent signs should warn people of their operation, according to Reuters.
A Chinese law professor won a
lawsuit against a safari park for requiring him to submit his face biometrics for park entry in late-2020, in a sign of changes to come, at least for the private sector.
The draft legislation is open for public comment until September 7.

The bill could permit the use of facial recognition for state surveillance, potentially diluting the Right to Information Act. Critics argue the law could also enable the collection of employee biometrics and allow the government to process citizen data without explicit consent. The bill will now face the higher house before it becomes law. Last year, a similar data protection bill was withdrawn by the government.","India’s data protection bill passes lower house of Parliament, raises privacy concerns
Biometrics News| ID for All
India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Bill of 2023 passed in the lower house of Parliament and will now face the higher house before it becomes law, according to
The Indian Express. The bill as currently written raises privacy concerns as the ever-broader implementation of Aadhaar digital IDs gives the national government control over more of its citizens’ data. The bill would exempt “any instrumentality of the state” from negative consequences, citing national security and maintaining public order as justifications. This means that the government would be able to use facial recognition to build surveillance systems, suggests Srinivas Kodali, a digitization researcher and self-described “hacktivist” in an opinion piece for The Wire.
Some worry that this law could dilute the Right to Information (RTI) Act. As the law stands now, the central government will maintain control in appointing members to the Data Protection Board – the board that would manage grievances and disputes related to privacy.
Employers would also be able to collect biometrics of employees. Government employees must share their face biometrics and are monitored by surveillance systems while they work. Sanitation workers are already struggling to cope with mass surveillance through GPS tracking smart watches with
cameras that can be turned on at any moment.
Under the data protection bill, the national government would be able to process citizens’ data without their express consent. Private companies would be required to obtain consent from their customers or users before processing their personal data, but exceptions are made for “legitimate uses.”
The data protection bill’s approval by the Lok Sabha follows the higher legislature passing the Registration of Births and Deaths Amendment Bill this week. The latter bill digitizes the registration of births and deaths and allows Indians to obtain driver’s licenses, register to vote, sign up for an Aadhaar number, and more with only a birth certificate, according to
NDTV.
“Indians will be forced to part with their personal information from birth to death,” argues Kodali.
The government argues that national and state-level databases of births and deaths will improve the delivery of social services and benefits.
An attempt by India’s government to pass a similar data protection bill was withdrawn last year.

DocuSign launches AI-backed live video ID verification tool
The e-signature vendor's new AI-supported identity confirmation tool uses biometrics and live video to verify signers' identity and physical presence at the time of signing.
DocuSign on Tuesday released an AI-backed identity verification tool.
The
electronic signature vendor's new tool, Liveness Detection for ID Verification, uses biometric visual scanning in live video recordings to confirm a document signer's identity and presence at the time of signing. It's generally available today as part of DocuSign's ID Verification and ID Verification Premier offerings at no extra cost, according to DocuSign.
DocuSign partnered with Onfido, an automated identity verification vendor, to create the system.
A native integration
DocuSign's new tool differentiates the e-signature vendor from competitor Adobe because Adobe does not offer this capability under the
Adobe Sign license, according to Futurum analyst Keith Kirkpatrick.
Rather, it has Adobe Digital Identity Gateway, which lets users access such tools from a third-party vendor.
By contrast, Liveness Detection for ID Verification sits in DocuSign's eSignature workflow, making it a native capability, which may take less time to access and use, Kirkpatrick said.
""DocuSign appears to be making it far easier to implement AI-powered ID verification in a much more integrated and simple way, which many organizations will value,"" he said.
Other competitors also offer comparable tools, IDC analyst Holly Muscolino noted. Like offerings from other platforms, DocuSign's new tool instructs users to move their heads in a particular way while on video to ensure they are real. However, the supporting technology is different.
""I have seen similar capabilities from other vendors, but they are not necessarily 'AI-enabled,'"" she said.
DocuSign holds a strong position against other electronic agreement vendors and maintains it by acquiring outside technology and developing modern tools, Muscolino said.
""DocuSign continues to dominate the e-signature market in terms of market share,"" Muscolino said.
Aiming for accuracy
Liveness Detection for ID Verification uses AI technology in
biometric analyses of users' live video selfies and compares it to analyses of users' photo IDs to confirm a true match.
The goal is to block the use of fraudulent documents and pre-recordings as well as
deep fakes, which are digitally altered video recordings that impersonate real people, and digital spoofing, which is impersonation through data.
When using
AI technology to provide authentication, analysis accuracy is a main concern, Kirkpatrick said. This accuracy depends on the diversity level of the data sets used to train the models that inform the algorithms, with higher diversity giving higher accuracy, he added.
Keith KirkpatrickAnalyst, Futurum Research
""Using AI models that are not highly accurate can have significant real-world repercussions, particularly if an AI identification-verification tool prevents a signer from completing a legal document, such as a contract, lease or employment offer letter,"" Kirkpatrick said.
DocuSign boosts the algorithm's fluency by evaluating liveness checks, according to Prakash Nanduri, DocuSign group vice president of product management and strategy.
""We will get the feedback and we will fine tune the algorithms … to improve the algorithmic accuracy,"" Nanduri said.
At this time, computer vision technology and
biometric analysis support the new tool. It does not actually use generative AI, but DocuSign is planning to incorporate the widely popular new variant of AI in the next 12 to 15 months, according to Nanduri.

News also emerged that Bosch sold thousands of cameras to Iran before sales were frozen due to human rights violations.","Governments, vendors less skittish about promoting facial recognition sales
Biometrics News| Facial Recognition| Law Enforcement
News of Colombia’s decision to buy facial recognition software from a Spanish company for its national police force lacks one point common in virtually all previous announcements by other nations.
There is no explicit mention of how the software, from
Herta Security, will be used to find missing and exploited children.
That missing fig leaf, just like others still plucked by governments globally to make more palatable the growing blanket of live surveillance cameras in public spaces, shows how Western attitudes are changing about face recognition algorithms.
According to the Colombia
announcement, 80 cameras in a facial recognition network in the city of Medellín. Images captured will be compared against a database of 19,000 faces – people with outstanding arrest warrants and those who could help police in searching for criminals.
The system’s cost has not been disclosed.
Also uncommon is how the announcement of the Rs1.4 billion (US$4.9 million) facial recognition project was handled in Karachi, Pakistan.
That project, called S-4, is supposed to create a net of cameras at 40 toll plazas around the city. All faces and license plates will be recorded.
Government officials have been unusually blunt. S-4 will be good for the city, but its primary purpose is surveilling to prevent crime and terrorism,
according to reporting by independent Pakistani newspaper the Dawn.
A large, engraved plaque commemorating the project stands at the first plaza to be updated, Sassui. No one entering or leaving the city, at least on the toll roads linking municipalities, will travel unexamined.
Less typical is the announcement by the CEO of Russian state-owned defense contractor Rostec.
NtechLab, a subsidiary of Rostec, installed its face surveillance systems for last year’s FIFA World Cup in Qatar.
In fact, the company says it has assembled networks for 36 nations, according to the
Tass news agency, which enjoys an uneven reputation for reliable reporting. It is known that India also has bought and deployed NtechLab facial recognition systems, and the company tells Tass that its software has been deployed to 220 cities in the country.
It is unusual for a vendor – private or public – to unilaterally announce it has sold this equipment to a government buyer.
Of course, sometimes news of government facial recognition projects just leaks.
Investigative journalism on the part of German broadcaster ARD reportedly has found that Bosch sold thousands of cameras to Iran, reportedly before such transactions were frozen due to human rights violations and other actions.
Bosch is a manufacturing conglomerate. Its wares include biometric surveillance infrastructure.
In this case, Bosch reportedly said it sent 8,000 cameras to Tehran between 2016 and 2018,
https://www.iranintl.com/en/202308074447 the independent anti-regime publication Iran International. The publication was reporting on the ARD report. According to the Telegraph news site, the theocracy’s ruling clerics use Bosch cameras to find and identify women not wearing a hijab.
If government use of facial recognition becomes more acceptable to electorates, and leaks will likely fade. But if the opposite happens, insiders will find a way to get that news out.

70715,09-08-2023 02:40,7723833,The Problem With Cybersecurity (and AI Security) Regulation,"The article discusses the implications of security regulations on emerging technology, like large language models. It uses the example of PCI-DSS, a security standard for the credit card industry, to illustrate how specific regulations can become outdated quickly. The article also mentions GDPR's broad approach to personal data, highlighting the conflicts it can cause between security and legal departments within organisations. The writer suggests that while security regulations have their merits, they can also hinder progress and potentially compromise security.","With the emergence of generative models, and large language models (LLMs) in particular, and the meteoric rise in the popularity of ChatGPT , there once again are calls for more security regulation.
As expected, the immediate reaction to a new and unexplored technology is fear, which may result in regulatory overreaction. Although I think security regulation has its merits, we must remember that it doesn't always achieve more security. Here are a few examples of security-related regulations that sounded like a good idea at first but achieved the opposite result.
PCI-DSS is a security standard developed by the credit card industry that applies to anyone who wants to swipe customer cards, or more technically, to anyone who stores, processes, and/or transmits cardholder data. Version 1.1 of the standard was developed in 2006 and required a minimum password length of seven characters. That may have been good enough at the time, but today's standard hardware is able to crack such passwords in anywhere from a few days to less than a second.
In March 2022, the standard was updated to a minimum length of 12 characters (or, if a system doesn't support 12 characters, a minimum length of eight characters). Nevertheless, this requirement is merely a best practice until it becomes binding on March 31, 2025. But while 12 is better than seven, this too will become crackable in the coming years.
Security regulation that is very specific becomes outdated very quickly.
The Downside of a Regulation Being General The flip side of specificity — namely regulation that is too general — can also have a detrimental effect on security. The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes to mind as an example of such a case. GDPR aims to protect personal information. According to the regulation, personal data is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable living individual. As you can see, the definition of personal data is very wide and all encompassing. It was already ruled by the Court of Justice of the European Union that IP addresses constitute personal data of the user . It's no wonder then, that security departments are in a constant battle with legal departments around the question of which logs they can collect to keep the organization safe.
As any blue-team professional will tell you, logs are crucial in providing visibility of the environment we are trying to protect. Without logs, we are mostly blind to both benign and also malicious activity on the network. Nevertheless, if logs can carry personal information of employees, customers, and suppliers, is it worth being more secure at the expense of risking to be fined up to 4% of global turnover? Unfortunately, due to the broadness of the regulations, organizations tune their answer to these questions mostly based on the conservativeness of the legal department.
Everyone Has an Opinion About Regulation Finally, we must also remember that any regulation is a product of never-ending debates and negotiations between different stakeholders, legislators, political lobbies, and industry and interest groups. As such, the final regulation draft will always reflect compromises that were made along the legislative journey. Unfortunately for us, in the security realm, any such compromises create suboptimal security and regulatory openings that may be exploited by attackers.
Therefore, we must remember that being secure and being compliant with regulations are two distinct things. It is not a coincidence that compliant organizations may still get breached, because compliance does not guarantee security. This result is quite disturbing, since it undermines the fundamental raison d'être of security regulation. If it's not there to ensure that we are truly secure, then why even bother?
A few years ago, several researchers published a paper that analyzed the effectiveness of regulation that imposed the obligation to have car safety seats for children. According to the researchers, US states have gradually been increasing the age at which children are required to use child safety seats since 1977. Because many standard-size cars cannot accommodate three child seats in the rear, these restrictions considerably increased the cost of having a third child. The researchers further estimate that 57 fewer children died in automobile accidents in 2017 as a result of these policies across the country. At the same time, they were responsible for the long-term drop of birth rates, which has resulted in 145,000 fewer births since 1980, with 90% of that loss occurring since the year 2000. It's easy to see then, how good regulatory intentions can turn out to have a negative effect.
Before imposing more security regulations upon organizations, we must ask ourselves: Are we really improving security, or are we just imposing more regulation?

While the fund is no longer registered with the SEC, it remains active under the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority. Additionally, Sino Global announced earlier this year that it has hired former FTX COO Constance Wang, who was once considered Bankman-Fried's ""right hand"" in fundraising, as its head of gaming. FTX Proposes Exchange Relaunch For Offshore Customers Earlier this month, FTX’s new management proposed to reboot the exchange for offshore customers only. In a recent filing, FTX’s management proposed to group the various creditors into different classes as a way for them to receive the claims they are entitled to. FTX.com customers will be categorized as “Dotcom Customer Entitlements” or “Class 4A” group of claimants under the plan, and this group will be entitled to proceeds from either a sale or recapitalization of a rebooted FTX exchange. Efforts around an FTX relaunch have gathered some stream as the platform has managed to recover over $7.3 billion in cash and liquid crypto assets. As reported , the effort to revive FTX has even drawn interest from Tribe Capital, a venture firm seeking to lead a $250 million fundraising campaign for the new platform. Back in May, crypto veteran Loomdart also expressed support for an FTX reboot as a way to make creditors whole and increase trust in the industry. Loomdart, who is also the co-founder of eGirl Capital, said an FTX relaunch could be successful if all users and creditors get a chunk of the platform. ""Right now, you have over a million people who have been badly impacted by this scam, but these are people that were using this product,"" he said, adding that giving FTX users a piece of the exchange could be very powerful because it would incentivize them to remain on the platform.",https://cryptonews.com/news/sino-global-capital-takes-legal-action-files-673-million-claim-against-ftx-trading-ltd.htm,economy and finances

The rates for our study are based on profiles for male and female drivers who are 17, 25, 35, and 60 years old. The vehicles used include the 2017 and 2022 Honda Civic, the 2017 and 2022 Toyota RAV4, and the 2017 and 2022 Ford F-150, with mileages of 6,000 and 12,000 annually, respectively. Coverage levels of low, medium, and high were used, as were credit tiers of poor, fair, and good. Clean driving records, as well as records with one accident, records with one speeding violation, and records with one DUI, were also used in the calculations for certain driver archetypes.
To get the rates for good drivers used in our study, we computed the mean rate for male and female drivers 17, 25, 35, and 60 years old who drive 12,000 miles per year, have medium coverage, good credit, and a clean driving record.
The rates in our study should not be considered “average” rates available by individual insurers. They are for comparative purposes only. Because car insurance rates are based on so many individual factors — age, location, driving record, type of vehicle, etc. — your car insurance rates will likely differ from those shown here.

Biometrics News| Trade Notes
UK Surveillance Camera and Biometrics Commissioner Fraser Sampson has stepped down. His emailed letter of resignation to Home Secretary Suella Braverman states that the functions of the two roles will be rendered irrelevant by the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill.
The Bill removes the responsibilities of the Biometrics Commissioner role and gives them to the Investigatory Powers Commissioner. This decision has been roundly criticized by
Sampson and his predecessor in the Surveillance Camera Commissioner role, Tony Porter, as well as UK academics and Porter’s Scottish counterpart. It also eliminates the need to publish the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice, effectively hamstringing the Commissioner, Sampson argues.
He explains the timing is linked to the passage of the Bill, which is now not expected to be signed into law until early 2024 or later. The original Data Protection and Digital Information Bill was withdrawn from parliament in March, and a
second version advanced to the committee stage in May.
“Having explored a number of alternatives with officials, I am unable to find a practical way in which I can continue to discharge the functions of these two roles beyond 1 November,” Sampson says.
Sampson was appointed to the dual roles in
March of 2021, and will remain in them until October 31.

Policies sold through its Kemper Personal Insurance brand will be non-renewed or cancelled in accordance with state regulations, Kemper said in a press release. Kemper Life and its specialty auto business, Kemper Auto, are not affected by changes, the insurer confirmed. Kemper’s preferred business has been under review since November 2022. Its preferred property and casualty (P&C) business is comprised of eight underwriting companies, accounting for around $500 million in premium. “The decision to exit the business was made after thoughtful evaluation of our options and considered the most effective and efficient way to support our stakeholders,” said Joseph P. Lacher, Jr., Kemper’s President, CEO and Chairman. “It enables us to release capital and increase the resources available to support our core specialty auto and life businesses.” Kemper has previously announced a $45.5 million after-tax goodwill impairment charge related to its preferred business strategic review. Kemper’s preferred auto and home insurance exit comes as some insurance companies have been reducing their personal lines exposure, with certain states feeling the brunt of changes. In July, Farmers Insurance confirmed it would end sales of its own-brand policies in Florida, in addition to cutting down on new business in California. State Farm and Allstate have both ceased sales of new policies in California. Nationwide Insurance has also confirmed corrective action across its personal and commercial portfolios.

These biometric devices were introduced during the general elections earlier in the year and were praised for enhancing poll transparency.

Biometrics News| Elections| ID for All
The Independent National Electoral Commission of Nigeria (INEC) will deploy 11,355 biometrics-based Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) machines for three governorship elections in the country by the end of the year.
Daily newspaper Punch
reports, citing an unnamed official within INEC, that the deployment will be done for the November 11 elections in the States of Bayelsa, Imo and Kogi.
The outlet quotes the official as saying that 2,400 BVAS devices will be deployed in Bayelsa, 5,079 in Imo, and 3,876 in Kogi. The number of devices to be deployed is more than the number of polling stations in those states, understandably as a precautionary measure to handle any likely glitches during the voter accreditation process.
INEC introduced the biometric devices during the general elections of February and March with the federal government later insisting that it
enhanced the transparency of the polls.
It suffered glitches notwithstanding, but the
BVAS machines were used as evidence by different parties during post-election litigations.
Yiaga Africa, a civil society organization which observed the general elections in Nigeria, recently noted in its report that the introduction of the BVAS was the right step in the right direction, but administrative and legislative measures should be taken in the future to ensure that the deployment of such technologies
meet certain key integrity and reliability standards.

David Middendorf, a former KPMG US managing partner for audit quality, and Jeffrey Wada, who worked at the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, were convicted of fraud over claims that Mr Wada passed confidential information to KPMG to help the firm prepare for PCAOB audit inspections, in the hope of being given a job at the big four firm. ","New York | Two people found guilty in a corruption scandal involving KPMG US and the US audit regulator will have their convictions dropped, after prosecutors conceded they had misinterpreted the law.
David Middendorf, a former KPMG US managing partner for audit quality, and Jeffrey Wada, who worked at the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, were convicted of fraud over claims that Mr Wada passed confidential information to KPMG to help the firm prepare for PCAOB audit inspections, in the hope of being given a job at the big four firm.
Two people found guilty in a corruption scandal involving KPMG US and the US audit regulator are set to have their convictions dropped. Bloomberg
The Department of Justice conceded this week in a court filing that its reading of wire fraud statutes was incorrect, in light of subsequent legal judgments in unrelated cases. It said it would ask for the jury verdict to be set aside and the charges dismissed.
Another KPMG audit quality partner, David Britt, who was deported to Australia after pleading guilty to a similar charge, is now planning to ask the court to allow him to reverse his plea so he can return to the US, his lawyer told the Financial Times .
Mr Middendorf and Mr Britt were among six partners and employees, including the head of the audit practice, who were fired by KPMG in 2017 after revelations it had hired multiple people from the PCAOB and used its contacts there to receive advance notice of which audits would be subject to inspection. The firm had been wrestling with persistently low audit quality scores from the inspection process.
Advertisement KPMG later paid $US50 million ($76 million) in a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the PCAOB, including charges related to the scandal. As part of the settlement it admitted using the advance notice to alter completed audits before inspectors arrived.
The DoJ secured criminal convictions from six people in all, three of whom admitted additional charges of conspiracy to defraud the SEC by interfering with the inspection process, as well as the wire fraud charges that have now been called into question.
The applicability of the wire fraud statutes turned on whether defendants were trying to steal “property” from the PCAOB or just affect the outcome of its inspections.
Recent judgments in unrelated cases, including a 2020 Supreme Court ruling, Kelly vs US, had clarified that wire fraud could not be brought against Mr Middendorf and Mr Wada, the DoJ said in a submission earlier this week to an appeals court considering appeals from Mr Middendorf and Mr Wada. The department asked for their case to be sent back to a lower court, where it said it would dismiss the charges.
Attorneys for Mr Middendorf and Mr Wada declined to comment.
Mr Britt pleaded guilty in 2019 to a single count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, admitting to obtaining confidential information on upcoming inspections and using it to improve results. Although he had been in the US for three decades, he had never become a US citizen and was deported as a result of the conviction.
Advertisement Rob Stern, a lawyer for Mr Britt, said he would try to have the guilty plea withdrawn.
“We fully expect now to go back, as I told the judge we would in these circumstances, to have the record expunged so that he can be reunited with the three college-age US children and wife who are still in the country,” Mr Stern said.",https://www.afr.com/companies/professional-services/court-moves-to-drop-fraud-convictions-in-kpmg-us-audit-scandal-20230807-p5dukx,"crime, law and justice"

The study found that 77% of US insurers held fossil fuel-related assets worth $536 billion in 2019. This threatens their financial stability, particularly as climate disasters increase and regulatory pressures on fossil fuel industries intensify. While some insurers reported significant changes in their investment strategies, the report suggests it will take several years for these shifts to become evident.","U.S.-based insurers have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in fossil fuel-related assets which in turn contribute to the risk of climate-related damage to the underwriting side of their businesses, a new report said on Tuesday. A data sample comprising 77% of U.S. insurers showed they held fossil fuel-related assets worth $536 billion in 2019, and patterns are unlikely to have changed dramatically since then, according to sustainability consultancy ERM, investor advocacy group Ceres and carbon accounting firm Persefoni. As governments and shareholders put increasing pressure on financial firms to measure and curb the flows of capital to businesses that warm the climate, the report says insurers are “uniquely exposed.” Climate catastrophes like wildfires are prompting some businesses to stop covering homes in high-risk areas like California, and decisions made on the investment side to put money in activities facing tougher regulation could squeeze their finances, Ceres managing director Steven Rothstein said. “If they have stranded costs on investments they won’t be able to pay out on underwriting,” Rothstein said. “While the day to day is different, strategically they are very connected.” The researchers interviewed executives, state regulators and other experts to assess what might have changed since 2019, the most recent year for which the data, collected by California regulators, was available. Some companies said they had made “huge changes,” and the researchers said there was evidence the sector had made a “significant effort” to respond to global expectations about how they loan to and invest in emitting companies, but that it would take several years for this to show. Insurers have to invest for the long term, meaning that assets like bonds might sit on their books for years after a policy shift. “We started excluding coal in 2015, but some of our coal bonds run for 20 years,” one executive from a Europe-headquartered insurance group said. All participants were granted anonymity. The report counted corporate utility assets as “fossil fuel-related,” but the researchers acknowledged that many in the sector are investing heavily in clean energy. Click for restrictions .

The guidelines, included on page 11 of this report , are centered around a number of essential areas in psychedelic-assisted therapy, such as: - Necessary licensure and/or certification for psychedelic-assisted therapy practitioners. - Necessary specialized training in psychedelic-assisted therapy crucial to ensure that practitioners possess the knowledge of “the potential physical, psychological, and spiritual effects of psychedelics and core principles of psychedelic-assisted therapy.” - The necessity of obtaining and documenting informed consent pre-treatment. - The need for practitioners to address the potential applications of touch in their consent forms, and the patient’s right to refuse touch except in situations where touch is necessary for harm reduction or harm prevention purposes. - The necessity of patient comprehensive screening before treatment essential to assess full health history and to create “an open, respectful, culturally-sensitive environment in which patients can feel safe expressing various aspects of their life experiences and identity.” - The necessity for practitioners to build rapport and trust with patients in the preparation stage. - The need to monitor patients for adverse events both during and following the treatment, and ensure that complications are addressed. - The necessity to support patients through psychedelic integration post-treatment, an essential component for patients to understand and reflect on their psychedelic experience, and for them to incorporate the desired changes into their lives, and so on. See guidelines below. In the recent press release announcing the new guidelines, Andrew Penn, MS, PMHNP, Clinical Professor, UC San Francisco School of Nursing and a member of the working group said, “The Professional Practice Guidelines are an important next step in the evolution and professionalization of psychedelic therapy. By seeking to clarify and define concepts such as consent, appropriate screening of patients, professionalism and ethics, safety, patient preparation, coordination with other providers, and integration of psychedelic therapy experiences, these guidelines will help to protect patients and advance the safe use of psychedelic medicines in professional settings.” “With the anticipated approval of MDMA to treat PTSD next year and the rollout of other psychedelic therapies to treat a variety of mental health disorders in the next few years, there is a growing need and desire on the behalf of the practitioners to be properly trained and prepared to deliver such life-changing treatment,” added Brigadier General (Ret.) Stephen N. Xenakis, MD, Executive Director of APPA. “Patient care, safety and experiential efficacy are of the utmost importance, especially when patients can be in such a vulnerable state during their experience, and these guidelines are the first step toward an approach for practitioners to get the support they need to effectively and safely administer this treatment.” Of course, these guidelines are not set in stone. The co-authors expressed that they will modify and update the recommendations as new findings and data emerge in the psychedelics field. These guidelines are set to expire in two years from their publication and updated ones will take their place. “Even though FDA approval for the first psychedelic-assisted therapy is still months away, researchers can use these guidelines today to design cutting-edge studies that will lead to new therapies tomorrow. We are proud to be leading the way as the medical field prepares for psychedelic-assisted therapy to become a crucial new tool in clinicians’ toolboxes,” added David Esselman, Executive Director of BrainFutures.",https://psychedelicspotlight.com/first-ever-professional-guidelines-for-psychedelic-assisted-therapy-practitioners-now-published-by-appa-and-brainfutures/,health

Tracey German, professor in conflict and security at King’s College London , said there had been a fourfold increase in the number of scholarships over the past decade, in an echo of Cold War tactics when the Soviet Union would train a country’s next generation of leaders to ensure friendly relations and win “hearts and minds”. ","Growth in the number of scholarships that Russia is offering to African students reveals the “soft power” being used by Moscow, experts said. Russian president Vladimir Putin recently said that there were more than 35,000 African students in his country, with 6,000 of them on scholarships bankrolled by the Kremlin. Tracey German, professor in conflict and security at King’s College London , said there had been a fourfold increase in the number of scholarships over the past decade, in an echo of Cold War tactics when the Soviet Union would train a country’s next generation of leaders to ensure friendly relations and win “hearts and minds”. “I do think this is about soft power and influence and looking for countries and areas where Russia can influence and shape and potentially displace Western states,” Professor German said. Ivan Klyszcz, a research fellow at the International Centre for Defence and Security, said Russia had for some time “regarded scholarships for higher education programmes as a cost-effective way to build influence across the globe ”. “The prestige of Russian universities and the legacies of Soviet technical and educational assistance abroad continue to attract students. “The effect is stronger where there was intensive cooperation on these matters with the Soviet Union,” he said. “Even though a few of the most prestigious universities of the Soviet Union are today outside of the Russian Federation, Russia has actively attempted to capitalise on this Soviet legacy for itself.” Moscow recently announced that the name of the People’s Friendship University of Russia (RUDN) in Moscow would revert back to the Patrice Lumumba Peoples’ Friendship University, re-honouring the Congolese politician 30 years after his name was taken off the public research institution. Dr Klyszcz, an expert on Russia-Africa relations, said this reflects the decision by Russia’s leadership to adopt an anti-colonial rhetoric in its foreign policy, especially towards the Global South. “This rhetoric still carries weight and echoes themes made popular during the Cold War. Like the scholarships, this is a Soviet legacy the Kremlin wants to capitalise on,” he said. Unlike other scholarships – such as the UK’s Chevening programme or the Fulbright scheme in the US – international students can only apply for funded spots at certain programmes selected by the Russian government. With Russia offering 15,000 spots in 2020, Dr Klyszcz said the scale is much bigger than those in rival countries – with Chevening offering fewer than 2,000 scholarships to foreign students per year, and Fulbright just 4,000. “There is an overtly transactional element to the allocation of spots per country,” he added. “The ‘better’ the relations between the two countries – in the view of the Russian authorities – the more spots are assigned to students from that country.” Professor German said the higher education element is just one part of Moscow’s re-engagement with Africa – following a “vacuum” created by the drawdown of US forces and the withdrawal of French troops. “The Global South more broadly Russia sees – particularly post-invasion [of Ukraine] – as an area where it is able to garner some influence and we have seen it over the last few years really trying to capitalise on what it saw as increasing Western disinterest and disengagement. “What we’ve seen is this narrative as Russia positioning itself as an anti-imperialist, anti-colonial power,” said Professor German. “It helps Russia in what it sees as a contestation with the West and it’s all part of that.” [patrick.jack@timeshighereducation.com](mailto:patrick.jack@timeshighereducation.com) Already registered or a current subscriber?

This program is accepting new applications for the 2024-2025 school year for students who enroll in dentistry, veterinary medicine, and optometry programs. ","New Mexico's Higher Education Department has announced that it is accepting applications for a program that will provide up to 100 percent student loan forgiveness for New Mexico residents who graduated from one of the 23 out-of-state professional and graduate programs.
This program is accepting new applications for the 2024-2025 school year for students who enroll in dentistry, veterinary medicine, and optometry programs.
The program is facilitated through Western Interstate Commission on Higher Education (WICHE) Loan-for-Service Program to provide residents with opportunities to study programs not currently offered by colleges and universities in New Mexico.
Students must declare their intent to return to New Mexico to practice as a professional in their chosen field. This program forgives a portion of student loans for each year the licensed medical professionals provide service in New Mexico after graduating from one of the approved graduate or professional programs.
Stephanie Rodriguez, higher education secretary for the NMHED, said in a statement that this program provides New Mexicans the opportunity to grow professionally while also providing a much-needed service to their home state.
""New Mexico is fully invested in recruiting and maintaining qualified, licensed professionals to serve our communities in high-need fields, but there are some advanced degree programs that are only offered in other states,"" said Stephanie Rodriguez, higher education secretary for the state.
More than 62 New Mexican residents benefited from this program last year, and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has approved $2.2 million for the program this year.
Along with loan forgiveness, New Mexico students are given preferred admission and reduced tuition rates when enrolled in one of the 23 out-of-state schools partnered with the NMHED. Most students in the program are eligible for in-state tuition rates at public universities and colleges or reduced standard tuition at private schools.
""This initiative presents a fantastic opportunity for New Mexico graduates to receive support as they pursue advanced degree programs in fields that are not currently offered within our state,"" said Patrick Allen, secretary for the New Mexico Department of Health. ""Through this program, we aim to attract and retain qualified professionals, ensuring that our communities have access to essential services in high-need areas. We encourage all eligible applicants to seize this chance to make a positive impact on their home communities and beyond. Together, we can build a stronger future for New Mexico.""",https://www.diverseeducation.com/leadership-policy/article/15543889/new-mexico-to-provide-student-loan-forgiveness-for-students-enrolling-in-health-programs,education

The clinic, located in Melbourne, will offer psychedelic-assisted therapy in seven treatment rooms. To prescribe psychedelic compounds, psychiatrists must be approved under the TGA’s Authorised Prescriber Scheme. Clarion aims to help the estimated 12% of Australians who will suffer from PTSD, and the 26.5% of Australians with depression who do not respond to standard treatments. The treatments will commence once approvals are received.","Clarion Clinics Group Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of Incannex Healthcare Ltd IXHL IHL is now accepting direct registration of interest in treatment from potential clients via its website ahead of its planned Q3 opening.
People who have an interest in treatment from Clarion can now register and request further information on the Clarion website.
Clarion’s first clinic is located on the Yarra Riverfront in the Melbourne suburb of Abbotsford, close to the city center. It’s a purpose-designed facility with seven treatment rooms and other facilities conducive to psychedelic-assisted therapy . The fit-out of the premises is expected to be completed before the end of August, facilitating opening shortly thereafter.
In order to be able to prescribe the psychedelic compounds to be used in Clarion’s PAT protocol, psychiatrists must be approved under the TGA’s Authorised Prescriber Scheme. Once Clarion‘s approvals have been received, treatments can commence.
Australian health authorities estimate that 12% of Australians will suffer from PTSD at some point in their lifetime, and 1.5% of the population (390,000 people) have a PTSD diagnosis at any given time. Certain groups, for example people who serve in the defence force, military veterans, first responders, and certain minority groups make up a disproportionate share of people who experience this debilitating mental health disorder.
Along with the many sufferers of PTSD, it’s estimated that 26.5% of the just over one million Australians who suffer depression (280,000 people) do not adequately respond to standard treatments.
“The term ‘treatment-resistant’ has misleading connotations, implying that all avenues have been exhausted and that front-line treatments work well for everyone else. In reality, neither are typically true. For people who have suffered with certain conditions that have not responded to available treatments, psychedelic-assisted therapies may provide substantial improvements to negative symptoms and quality of life. At Clarion Clinics, our aim is to achieve the best outcomes possible using psychedelic therapies, through tailored and extended protocols and a brilliant team,” stated Dr. Paul Liknaitzky .

The new figure is higher than previous estimates made three months and six weeks after the event. The estimation includes losses from the property business line, excluding other lines of business and losses from Syria. The event, which involved three major earthquakes, resulted in immense loss of life and displacement of people. This is considered the costliest catastrophe event in Turkey’s history.","Zurich-based catastrophe insurance data provider PERILS AG has updated its insured property market loss estimate for the Kahramanmaras Earthquake Sequence to TRY 92.8 billion, which is approximately $4.9bn at February 2023 exchange rates and $3.4bn at the current exchange rates.
This new loss figure compares to the previous PERILS estimates of
TRY 86.4 billion issued three months after the event, and TRY 65.4 billion issued six weeks after the event.
According to the firm’s coverage definition for Turkey, the numbers include losses from the property line of business. Losses from other lines of business, as well as losses from Syria, are not included.
Luzi Hitz, CEO of PERILS, commented, “At current exchange rates, TRY 92.8bn translates to approximately USD 3.4bn or EUR 3.1bn. However, in February 2023 when the earthquakes struck, TRY 92.8bn equated to approximately USD 4.9bn or EUR 4.6bn.
“Currency fluctuation is one example of the many challenges facing the Turkish insurance market as it continues to successfully process an unprecedented number of insurance claims from this event.
“We are deeply grateful to our insurance partners for providing PERILS with this detailed loss information during such demanding times and trust that our industry data will help to increase the understanding of Turkish earthquake risk.”
PERILS explained that the Kahramanmaras Earthquake Sequence consisted of three major earthquakes measuring Mw 7.8, Mw 6.7, and Mw 7.5 on the moment magnitude scale.
The catastrophe insurance data provider continued, “They occurred along the southwestern end of the East Anatolian fault system and caused extreme ground shaking in south-central Turkey and northwestern Syria.
“The impacted region is highly seismically active, sitting at the triple-junction between the Anatolian, Arabian, and African tectonic plates.
“The East Anatolian Fault is a 700km long, northeast-southwest network of strike-slip faults that separate the Anatolian micro-plate to the north from the Arabian plate to the south, accommodating the westward extrusion of Turkey into the Aegean Sea.”
PERILS also highlighted that the earthquake sequence caused immense loss of life and human suffering. According to the firm, more than 59,000 people lost their lives, and an estimated 3 million people were displaced.
Official government figures put the cost of direct physical damage at TRY 1.6 trillion and indirect economic costs at TRY 350bn.

70691,09-08-2023 02:36,7723797,First Ever Professional Practice Guidelines For Providing Psychedelic-assisted Therapy Published - Benzinga,"The American Psychedelic Practitioners Association (APPA) and BrainFutures have released the first-ever professional practice guidelines for psychedelic-assisted therapy. The move comes as the FDA considers approval of psychedelic-assisted treatments for various mental health disorders. The guidelines, which were developed through a consensus-based process and draw on existing clinical research, aim to set a benchmark for clinical practitioners. The document covers training, screening processes, patient preparation and consent, among other aspects. The guidelines will be updated periodically, expiring two years from their initial publication date.","The American Psychedelic Practitioners Association (APPA ) and BrainFutures have published reportedly the first-ever set of professional practice guidelines for the provision of psychedelic-assisted therapy. APPA is the national entity advocating for the integration of psychedelics into the U.S. healthcare system.
The partners say that the specificity of the psychedelic therapy model -combining psychedelic administration and therapy in the same session- calls for practitioners to hold “new processes and competencies.”
With the FDA's imminent approval of one or more psychedelic-assisted therapies, consensus-based guideline are necessary for the development process toward speeding the adoption of these treatments for a variety of mental health disorders into the U.S. healthcare system and ensuring access “for all who could benefit.”
BrainFutures executive director David Esselman says researchers can start using these guidelines “to design cutting-edge studies that will lead to new therapies tomorrow,” which will likely become “a crucial new tool in clinicians’ toolboxes.”
Brig. Gen. (Ret.) Dr. Stephen Xenakis, APPA’s executive director added that practitioners show “a growing need and desire to be properly trained and prepared” to deliver these treatments.
The newly-published guidelines aim to set a benchmark for practitioners in the emerging clinical field, as informed by existing clinical research and multidisciplinary expert consensus, toward further legitimizing the psychedelic-assisted therapy space and practices.
Over 20 APPA members also contributed their perspectives on justice, equity, diversity and inclusion, real-world practice, and psychedelic use in indigenous and other settings.
The document includes core and contextualized points regarding appropriate training, licenses and certifications; comprehensive screening processes; preparation and integration toward the best facilitated experience possible; the importance of informed consent as an ongoing and thorough process and building trust and rapport between practitioners and patients; consistent monitoring during and after including continuity of care, among others.
UC-SF clinical professor and working group member Dr. Andrew Penn says that “by seeking to clarify and define concepts such as consent, appropriate screening of patients, professionalism and ethics, safety, patient preparation, coordination with other providers, and integration of psychedelic therapy experiences, these guidelines will help to protect patients and advance the safe use of psychedelic medicines in professional settings.”
As commonly occurs in the development of professional practice guidelines, and especially in the case of psychedelic-assisted therapy, co-authors have agreed these guidelines will be subject to change in the coming years as more research and real-world data becomes available. Accordingly, they will expire two years from their publication date, with updated guidelines to follow.

The company's combined ratio deteriorated to 106.8% from 96.2% in Q2 2022 due to an increased loss ratio. Gross written premiums reduced by 23.2% year-on-year to $561.9 million, attributed to sold and exited businesses. Despite this, Argo's net investment income rose by 11.9% to $32.8 million, and the net loss for Q2 2023 improved to $0.5 million from a loss of $18.9 million a year ago. Argo's CEO, Thomas A. Bradley, emphasized the company's focus on improving profitability and reducing earnings volatility.","Argo Group International Holdings, Ltd. has announced a deterioration in its combined ratio to 106.8% for Q2 2023 compared with 96.2% in Q2 2022, as the firm reports an underwriting loss of $22.4 million for the period on the back of a higher loss ratio.
The Q2 2023 underwriting loss compares with a gain of $17.3 million a year earlier, as the loss ratio increased from 60.8% to 73.2%, driven by a slight rise in catastrophe losses to $3.1 million, and net adverse prior year reserve development of $26.4 million.
Last year, the loss ratio included cat losses of $2.5 million, and net adverse prior year reserve development of $16.3 million.
For Q2 2023, the company’s gross written premiums (GWP) saw a year-on-year decrease of 23.2%, standing at $561.9 million, compared to the $732.1 million for Q2 2022. The declines is attributed to the businesses the company has sold and exited.
The gross written premiums within the company’s ongoing business have also decreased by approximately 0.8% from the prior year’s second quarter.
Meanwhile, earned premiums are currently at $329.9 million, showing a decrease year over year from $124.4 million in Q2 2022, reflecting a 27.4% difference.
Although, Argo’s net investment income, which stands at $32.8 million for Q2 2023, has increased by $3.5 million or 11.9% from Q2 2022. The increase has been attributed to higher interest rates, partially offset by lower returns from alternative investments.
All in all, Argo has reported a net loss of $0.5 million in the second quarter of 2023, which is an improvement on the net loss of $18.9 million reported a year earlier. The Q2 2023 net loss included pre-tax net realized investment and other gains of $1.6 million, compared with pre-tax net realized investment and other losses of $40.4 million in Q2 2022.
Thomas A. Bradley., Argo’s Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Our second quarter performance further reflects the proactive steps we are taking to prioritize improving profitability. Our top-line results reflect our deliberate and disciplined actions in certain lines of business.
“However, we continue to achieve growth across the rest of the portfolio, notably in our environmental, inland marine and casualty segments. This is a testament to the importance of a diversified book of specialty businesses. We have remained focused on lowering expenses and reducing earnings volatility. The success of these efforts was demonstrated in the second quarter by further improvement in the expense ratio, and a low level of catastrophe losses, despite elevated industry catastrophe losses during the period.

70689,09-08-2023 02:35,7723796,Understanding Active Directory Attack Paths to Improve Security,"Microsoft Active Directory, the default identity and access management service in Windows networks, and its cloud-based counterpart, Azure Active Directory, are critical to the function of on-prem, cloud-based, and hybrid ecosystems. Active Directory manages and assigns user roles and authorizations, including verifying passwords and user groups. However, issues such as missed patches, poor access management, and misconfigurations can enable cyber attackers to compromise even the most sensitive systems. Research in 2022 found that 73% of top attack techniques involved mismanaged or stolen credentials, often involving some element of Active Directory compromise.","Introduced in 1999, Microsoft Active Directory is the default identity and access management service in Windows networks, responsible for assigning and enforcing security policies for all network endpoints. With it, users can access various resources across networks. As things tend to do, times, they are a'changin' – and a few years back, Microsoft introduced Azure Active Directory, the cloud-based version of AD to extend the AD paradigm, providing organizations with an Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) solution across both the cloud and on-prem apps. (Note that as of July 11th 2023, this service was renamed to Microsoft Entra ID , but for the sake of simplicity, we'll refer to it as Azure AD in this post)
Both Active Directory and Azure AD are critical to the functioning of on-prem, cloud-based, and hybrid ecosystems, playing a key role in uptime and business continuity. And with 90% of organizations using the service for employee authentication, access control and ID management, it has become the keys to the proverbial castle.
Active Directory, Actively Problematic But as central as it is, Active Directory security posture is often woefully lacking.
Let's take a quick peek at how Active Directory assigns users, which will shed some light on why this tool has some shall we say, issues, associated with it.
At the core, what Active Directory does is establish groups that have roles and authorizations associated with them. Users are assigned a username and password, which is then linked to their Active Directory Account Object. Using Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, passwords are verified as correct or incorrect and the usergroup is also verified. In general, users are assigned to the Domain User group and will be granted access to the objects that domain users have authorization to access. Then there are Admins – these are users assigned to the Domain Admins group. This group is highly privileged and is thus authorized to perform any actions in the network.
With such potentially potent capabilities, it's super critical to ensure that Active Directory is managed and configured optimally. Issues like missed patches, poor access management and misconfigurations can allow attackers to access even the most sensitive systems, which can have dire consequences.
In 2022, our in-house research found that 73% of the top attack techniques used in the compromising of critical assets involved mismanaged or stolen credentials – and more than half of the attacks in organizations include some element of Active Directory compromise. And once they have a foothold in Active Directory, attackers can perform loads of different malicious actions like:
Hiding activity in the network Executing malicious code Elevating privileges Getting into the cloud environment to compromise critical assets Point is, if you don't know what's happening in your Active Directory, and if you're lacking the proper processes and security controls, you're likely leaving the door wide open to attackers.
Download our latest research report , and discover How many steps it takes for attackers to typically compromise your critical assets Top exposures and hygiene issues that form attack paths Key findings related to attacks across hybrid, on-prem or multi-cloud networks. Active Directory Attack Paths From an attacker's POV, Active Directory serves as a great opportunity for conducting lateral movement, as gaining that initial access allows them to move from a low-privileged user to a more valuable target – or even to fully take over – by exploiting misconfigurations or overly excessive permissions.
So now let's take a look into the anatomy of 3 actual Active Directory attack paths and see how attackers made their way through this environment.
Here is an attack path we came across in one of our customer's environment:
The organization was deeply committed to hardening their security posture but Active Directory was a blind spot. In this case, all authenticated users – essentially any users at all – in the domain had been accidentally granted the right to reset passwords. So if an attacker took over one Active Directory user via phishing or other social engineering techniques, they could then reset any passwords for other users and take over any account in the domain.Once they saw this, they finally understood their Active Directory security approach needed to level-up so they locked down and hardened their security practices.
Here's another one from one of our customer's Active Directory;
We uncovered an attack path using the authenticated users group with permissions to change the GPO policy's gPCFileSysPath to a path with malicious policies.
One of the affected objects was the AD User Container, with a child object that was a user which was part of the Domain Admin group. Any user in the domain could get Domain Admin permissions -- all they needed was one non-privileged user to fall prey to a phishing email to compromise the entire domain. This could have led to a complete compromise of their domain.
Ready for one more? Here it is:
This one starts with an attacker infiltrating an enterprise environment via phishing mail that when opened, executed code using a vulnerability on an unpatched machine. The next step exploited the compromised Active Directory user's local and domain credentials through credential dumping techniques. The attacker then had the permissions to add themselves to a group so they could add the compromised Active Directory user to an Active Directory helpdesk group.
The helpdesk group had the Active Directory permissions to reset other users passwords and at this stage, the attacker could reset a password to another user, preferably an old, out of use admin. Now that they were an admin, they could perform lots of harmful activities in the network, such as running malicious code by adding a script logon to other users in Active Directory.
These are just some relatively simple ways attackers make their way across Active Directory environments. By understanding these actual real-world attack paths, organizations can start to see what their Active Directory and AD Azure environments look like from the attacker's point of view.
Watch on-demand How To Overcome Active Directory Exploits And Prevent Attacks to learn: How Active Directory (AD) exposures combined with other attack techniques form attack paths What kind of actions the attacker can perform once they compromise an AD user What to do for better Active Directory Security Conclusion Looking at attack paths can help shore up these potentially tricky environments. By getting a comprehensive view of the attack paths that exist in Active Directory across on-prem and cloud environments, organizations can learn how attackers move laterally with a context-based understanding of their environment – giving them visibility into how issues can combine to facilitate attacks and impersonate users, escalate privileges, and gain access to cloud environments.
With this understanding, organizations can prioritize what really needs fixing and harden environments to prevent Active Directory weaknesses from being leveraged by threat actors.",https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/understanding-active-directory-attack.html,social issue

Despite numerous stablecoins in the cryptocurrency market, PayPal will stand out as the pioneer in launching such a stablecoin among prominent payment processing entities. Legislative Impact: The Clarity for Payments Stablecoin Bill The stablecoin landscape is poised for a significant transformation as The Clarity for Payments Stablecoin Bill secures passage in the House Financial Committee. Significantly, on Monday, PayPal, a payments company, created waves by revealing its forthcoming stablecoin launch. This announcement is anticipated to exert a widespread influence on financial firms and payment processors, owing to the manifold applications that stablecoins present. Back in February 2019, Wall Street’s prominent financial entity, JP Morgan, introduced its stablecoin, the JPM Coin, to enhance wholesale payment procedures. Given this situation, PayPal’s bold step towards introducing a stablecoin might catalyze its rivals within the financial and payments sector to delve deeper into cryptocurrency. Despite the regulatory ambiguities regarding cryptocurrency utilization in the U.S., this action could signify a favorable indication for adopting cryptocurrencies, particularly within the payments domain.",https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/paypals-stablecoin-launch-could-propel-bitcoin-to-250000-and-ethereum-to-10x/,economy and finances

This development comes amidst a surge in identity fraud, accelerated by the rise of AI-powered image manipulation tools. To fortify its identity verification services, ComplyCube has introduced the ID Liveness Layer which uses Presentation Attack Detection technology to recognize a range of fraudulent activities. The Document Liveness Detection feature is fully integrated into the Document Checking Service and is available through various channels. This feature has proven effective in trial runs, preventing over 80% of fraudulent attempts.","ComplyCube has enhanced its Document Authentication service to counter ‘screen replay attacks’, where scammers attempt to use IDs displayed on digital screens for illicit access to products and services.
The announcement arrives in the context of a rise in identity fraud, propelled by advancements in AI-powered image manipulation tools. In the US, an identity theft case occurs every 22 seconds, while in the UK, identity fraud accounts for almost 70% of the cases filed with the National Fraud Database (NFD). These startling statistics highlight the urgent need to improve ID verification services as a crucial measure in fighting the unprecedented surge in identity fraud cases.
Complementing its existing offering of passive (still photos) and active (action based) biometric checks, the ID Liveness Layer uses Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) technology. Employing 3D face maps and cutting-edge techniques, it recognizes screen photos, printed photo attacks, video-replay assaults, and 3D mask attacks.
“Over the years, we have been committed to researching, developing, and deploying AI models for accurate and unbiased customer presence detection in images and videos. This has positioned us as a trusted liveness detection service provider, heavily depended on by some of the world’s biggest organizations,” notes
Harry Varatharasan, Chief Data Scientist of ComplyCube. “We’ve now extended our AI platform to detect liveness in ID documents, further enhancing the level of identity assurance provided by our award-winning platform.”
Document Liveness Detection is fully integrated into the Document Checking Service. Consequently, it is accessible to users across multiple channels, such as SDKs, no-code solutions, and the outreach platform. By adopting this feature, users can ascertain the legitimacy and rightful ownership of their customers’ identity documents throughout onboarding. Trial runs with select businesses have shown this feature’s effectiveness, preventing over 80% of fraudulent attempts.

What's driving auto insurance premium hikes? | Insurance Business America Motor & Fleet What's driving auto insurance premium hikes? ""It's probably the worst period for auto insurers it's been in 30 years at least"" Motor & Fleet
By Mika Pangilinan
The US auto insurance sector is grappling with what experts are calling its most significant crisis in three decades, with insurers facing challenges that have led to soaring price hikes.
Auto insurance costs increased 16.9% from the previous year, according to the consumer price index (CPI) for June.
Furthermore, a recent study by J.D. Power found that nearly a third of auto insurance customers have encountered a rate increase in the past year alone.
This surge has been attributed to record-high losses for insurers, as they face larger expenses associated with repairing or replacing vehicles.
The return to pre-pandemic driving habits has also led to heightened claims, with accidents, litigation, and medical costs now increasing.
Amid this environment, insurers on average reported losses of 12 cents for every dollar of premium written in 2022, according to J.D. Power.
“It’s probably the worst period for auto insurers it’s been in 30 years at least,” Neil Alldredge, chief executive of industry body National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, told the Wall Street Journal in June.
Major players like State Farm and Allstate have been compelled to increase premiums in a bid to offset these losses.
State Farm has increased rates by 13.3% in Texas, 8.2% in Pennsylvania, 6.9% in California, and 6.5% in Illinois. It also recently implemented a 17.3% rate hike in Louisiana, as announced by state insurance commissioner Jim Donelon.
Allstate, meanwhile, secured approval for 83 rate increases in various states in the first quarter of this year.

Along with Ark, eight other financial giants including BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, and WisdomTree, are awaiting approval.","- SEC to consider approval of Ark’s spot Bitcoin ETF ahead this week on August 13. - Ark Invest chief Cathie Wood believes that the securities regulator should approve all Bitcoin ETF applications at once. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is facing a deadline of August 13 in order to either approve or disapprove Ark Invest’s spot Bitcoin ETF application. Along with Ark, eight other financial giants including BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, and WisdomTree, are awaiting approval. Ark submitted an application for a spot in Bitcoin ETF to the Federal Register on May 15. The SEC announced in the Federal Register on June 15 that it would make a decision on the application by August 13. Also, the Federal Register mentioned Aug. 13 “as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change.” But the SEC has the option to extend the decision deadline to up to 240 days. This means that the final response from the SEC for the Ark application could potentially be delayed until January 10, 2024. Other applications, like the one from Bitwise Asset Management, could be delayed until March 2024. SEC’s Back and Forth With Bitcoin ETFs In the past, the SEC said “no” to applications for regular Bitcoin ETFs due to concerns about market manipulation and fraud in the markets. However, it did approve the ETFs linked to Bitcoin futures. Now, the new batch of applications has something different: an agreement to share information with exchanges like Nasdaq and Cboe. This means they would share details about trading, clearing, and customer IDs. This could help prevent cheating in the markets and make sure your investment doesn’t end up in the wrong hands, like what happened with FTX. However, it’s not sure if these changes will make the SEC say “yes” to a regular Bitcoin ETF. Reports say the SEC wasn’t happy with the new applications and exchanges are hurrying to fix things in their applications to satisfy the SEC. SEC to Approve All Spot Bitcoin ETFs Simultaneously Considering that the world’s top financial giants are in the race for spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, it would be difficult for the US SEC to pick one over the other and give the first mover advantage. Thus, many analysts believe that the SEC would approve several spot Bitcoin ETF applications at once. World’s largest crypto asset manager Grayscale was among the first to propose this. In an interview with Bloomberg TV on Monday, August 7, Cathie Wood said: “I think the SEC, if it’s going to approve a Bitcoin ETF, will approve more than one at once”. This was quite in reverse to her earlier view wherein Cathie Wood stated that her firm would be the first to get a potential approval of the long-awaited product. Wood believes that approving all spot Bitcoin ETF applications at once could usher more than $50 billion in demand for the asset class. “I believe Cathie is noticing and learning about the same things we are,” said James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. He also mentioned that the easiest way forward for the regulator would be to give the green light to all, or at least several, Bitcoin investment funds simultaneously. This is especially true if Grayscale Investments LLC is successful in its legal case against the SEC.",https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/sec-rule-on-arks-bitcoin-etf-near-btc-surge-possible-with-multiple-firms-awaiting-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval/,economy and finances

White Papers and Reports
Passwords are a challenging and a highly imperfect solution for granting account access to your trusted customers. Asking customers to re-assert their identity at every touchpoint only leads to frustration and abandonment. And passwords leave customers vulnerable to identity theft and account takeover attacks.
For financial services firms and their customers alike, the risks and costs associated with passwords far outweigh the benefits.
Biometrics that can leverage widely available consumer devices are a more secure and convenient way to authenticate customers. But not all approaches are equal. In this e-book by

Known as borrower defense to repayment, the regulations— which took effect July 1 —made it easier for borrowers who were defrauded or misled by a college to seek relief and potentially see their loans discharged.","You have /5 articles left. Sign up for a free account or log in. Caroline Brehman/CQ-Roll Call Inc./Getty Images A federal appeals court has blocked the latest version of U.S. Education Department rules that allow borrowers to apply for relief from their student debt if their college or university misled them or violated certain state laws. Known as borrower defense to repayment, the regulations— which took effect July 1 —made it easier for borrowers who were defrauded or misled by a college to seek relief and potentially see their loans discharged. The Biden administration has already used the new rules to forgive $130 million in student loans for 7,400 borrowers who were enrolled at a for-profit college in Colorado that closed in 2020. Department officials said last month to expect more loan discharges related to borrower defense. A trade association representing for-profit colleges in Texas sued the Biden administration in February, arguing that the new regulations affecting borrower defense to repayment claims and closed-school discharges exceeded the Education Department’s authority and were unconstitutional. “The apparent goals of this new framework are to accomplish massive loan forgiveness for borrowers and to reallocate the correspondingly massive financial liability to institutions of higher education,” Career Colleges & Schools of Texas (CCST) wrote in its initial complaint. “The final rule will cause financial and reputational harm to schools, educational harm to students, and budgetary harm to the public fisc.” A federal judge denied the group’s motion for a preliminary injunction but did put the new rules on hold for the association’s members while the case was appealed. The Texas group appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, seeking a national injunction. A three-judge panel granted the request in a brief order and scheduled a hearing for Nov. 6. To grant an injunction, a court must decide in part whether the party suing can show that it would suffer irreparable harm and that it is likely to succeed on the merits. The order didn’t take a stance on the merits of CCST’s argument. Debt relief and consumer protection advocates criticized the appeal court’s decision. “This unexplained order from the Fifth Circuit is a gift to those who wish to operate predatory education schemes with impunity,” said Eileen Connor, president and director of the Project on Predatory Student Lending. “Borrower defense is an essential safeguard that has been in place for decades. It is necessary to protect students from being scammed, and it ensures that predatory actions come to light and are stopped before they go on to harm even more students.” Aaron Ament, president of the National Student Legal Defense Network, said in a statement that defrauded students are legally entitled to relief. “Until these protections are restored, countless students are at risk of being taken advantage of by higher ed profiteers who are exploiting students with little accountability,” Ament said. Career Education Colleges and Universities, the national association representing for-profit institutions and a supporter of the lawsuit, opposed the new borrower-defense rule in comments to the Education Department and led a campaign about the rule’s “devastating impact.” It applauded the court’s order. “CCST’s legal case against the Department of Education’s unlawful BDR rule is strong and we are confident that when the case is brought forward the facts will show the new rule to be an agency overreach in violation of the department’s authority, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Constitution,” CECU president Jason Altmire said in a statement. Other higher education associations, including the American Council on Education, were generally supportive of the department’s goals in crafting the new borrower-defense rules. In comments to the department, ACE did raise concerns about how the rules could have “negative unintended consequences for institutions acting in good faith and in compliance with the spirit of the proposed regulations.” CCST wrote in filings that the rule was not fair and equitable for institutions, depriving them of a chance to respond to claims in borrowers’ applications for debt relief. “The department compounded this overreach by stacking the deck in favor of borrowers and against schools; the rule imposes strict liability upon schools for even unintentional erroneous representations or omissions, and then irrationally presumes that every borrower in the group would not have attended the school but for the school’s act or omission, whatever it is,” the group wrote in filings. Under the regulations, the department can grant relief based on one of five circumstances: substantial misrepresentation, substantial omission of fact, breach of contract, aggressive and deceptive recruitment, or judgments or final secretarial actions. CCST wrote in filings that the new rules have created compliance costs for institutions by having to preserve more student records and to provide training for staff to avoid misrepresentations in talking to students, among other costs. Those costs amount to an irreparable harm, which is the key standard for an injunction, the association argued. One CEO testified that in preparation for the new rules, his institution has been “dedicating or allocating staff and resources to handle the anticipated flood of meritless borrower defense claims that will be submitted following the effective date,” according to the injunction motion. The Biden administration argued in filings that the Texas group has not established irreparable harm and the 2022 regulations are similar to previous iterations in 2016 and 2019. “CCST nevertheless asserts that its members are injured by the borrower-discharge provisions on the theory that the schools’ contemporary conduct could one day lead to a borrower-defense claim, and, if that claim is granted, the department could then seek to hold the school liable for any discharged loans in a hypothetical recoupment proceeding,” the administration wrote.

70675,09-08-2023 02:33,7723779,Asset Managers “not Supporting” Climate Policy,"A recent FinanceMap analysis of 45 of the world's largest asset managers found that many are members of industry associations that have tried to weaken sustainable finance policies. Asset managers, who collectively manage $72tn, are not strongly supporting these policies, despite their claims of doing so. The report assessed the asset managers in areas including equity portfolio analysis and sustainable finance policy engagement. Major U.S. and European associations scored an average 'D-' on policy engagements, which indicates broad opposition to policies aligning with the Paris Agreement. Moreover, no U.S.-based asset manager strongly advocated for sustainable finance policy.","Research highlights the role of industry associations in attempting to water down sustainable finance policies.
Asset owners have developed a “blind spot” for asset managers’ lobbying activities surrounding sustainable finance policy, but are increasingly focused on improving alignment with climate goals.
Recent FinanceMap
analysis of 45 of the world’s largest asset managers, collectively managing US$72 trillion, found many were not strong and consistent supporters of sustainable finance policies.
The vast majority (86%) belong to at least one industry association that has strategically advocated to weaken key sustainable finance policies, according to the report. None of the world’s largest ten asset managers scored higher than a ‘D’ on policy engagement.
“Asset managers are not supporting the level of sustainable finance policy ambition they claim is important in their top line messaging,” Daan Van Acker, Programme Manager at think tank InfluenceMap’s FinanceMap Programme, told ESG Investor.
“In some cases, they are even being oppositional to emerging policy, either directly or through their industry associations.”
Patrick Peura, Engagement Track Co-Lead for the Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA), said it is “a major problem” for any company to say it supports net zero emissions while simultaneously lobbying against it, directly or indirectly.
The FinanceMap report assessed asset managers across three criteria: equity portfolio analysis, stewardship of investee companies, and sustainable finance policy engagement.
“We do see that there is a blind spot when it comes to asset managers’ lobbying activities around sustainable finance policies,” said Van Acker.
Negatively engaged
Major associations in the US, such as the Investment Company Institute (ICI), and in Europe, such as EFAMA, averaged a ‘D-’ total score on their policy engagements, which the report said is significantly lower than that of many asset managers and “points towards broad opposition to policies aimed at aligning financial flows with the Paris Agreement”.
FinanceMap said that ICI has been actively and negatively engaged with the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) efforts to give investors more information about funds’ and advisers’ incorporation of ESG factors and to update the ‘Names Rule’ to better incorporate ESG-related labels.
ICI declined to comment.
Further, no US-based asset manager stood out as a positive advocate on sustainable finance policy, the report said, with US managers instead focused on “limited but positive engagement of general climate ambitions”, while outlining objections to specific policies.
In Europe, EFAMA has been highly engaged with EU policies, with the report stating that the association argued for voluntary disclosure requirements and weaker thresholds to define sustainable investments in the EU taxonomy.
EFAMA did not respond to a request for comment.
“The main reason this is an issue is because many asset managers don’t directly engage with policy in the same way they do with investee companies, instead relying on their industry associations,” said Van Acker.
“We also see a number of industry associations taking the lowest common denominator position of their members, resulting in potentially more ambitious managers being underrepresented.
“Asset owners need to be challenging managers on this, ensuring that there is alignment between both direct and indirect lobbying with top line climate ambitions,” he said.
“Progress is needed”
Peura, also ESG Engagement Manager at Allianz, said many managers understood the need to align lobbying with their commitments and policies supporting portfolio decarbonisation.
“We have seen good uptake of this principle by asset managers generally, but the FinanceMap findings clearly show progress is needed in managers actually walking the talk,” said Peura, who is also ESG Engagement Manager at Allianz.
The NZAOA’s April
paper on asset management climate policy engagement said that managers’ stewardship of portfolio companies should be consistent with their stated climate goals and responsible climate lobbying.
“If we want to meet our real-world decarbonisation goals, it is imperative that policy action, as influenced by corporate lobbying and engagement, is supported by constructive corporate lobbyists,” said Peura.
Olga Hancock, Head of Responsible Investment for the UK’s Church Commissioners, said: “We encourage asset managers to enhance their policy advocacy on this area and align with the Paris Agreement.”
FinanceMap’s findings were “slightly disturbing”, said Jacqueline Jackson, Head of Responsible Investment at London CIV, a UK local government pension scheme, as the report “covers a lot of managers that we have in our own investment portfolio”.
Jackson told ESG Investor that she would use the report to benchmark managers to “drill down into the specific funds we hold with them”, comparing the findings against each manager’s overall performance.
“While we [asset owners] have tens of thousands of investee companies, we work with [a handful] of asset managers, so it’s much easier for us to check their behaviour in terms of transparency and disclosure, governance, engagement, and their actual carbon footprint,” she said.
Misaligned with Paris
The FinanceMap report found that 95% of managers’ portfolios are currently misaligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement and the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Net Zero by 2050 scenario, with little progress made over the last two years.
Analysing US$16.4 trillion of the assessed asset managers’ equity fund portfolios, the report found that managers hold 2.8 times more equity value in fossil fuel production companies (US$880 billion) than in green investments (US$309 billion). Green investments were calculated according to the criteria of the EU taxonomy.
Of the sample, only Schroders and Natixis currently manage their portfolios in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.
The portfolios of Goldman Sachs, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street were found to be “significantly misaligned” with the Paris Agreement, whereas China’s Ping An was the most misaligned firm globally.
European asset managers typically outperformed the sample, scoring ‘B-’ or better, including Allianz Global Investors, UBS and BNP Paribas Asset Management. Schroders and BNP Paribas AM have a 2.7 times higher exposure to green investments than the average asset manager, the report noted, adding that Goldman Sachs and State Street are the most exposed to the fossil fuel production value chain, at 2.2 times compared to the average asset manager in the sample.
The portion of asset managers carrying out effective stewardship practices relative to best practice has also decreased since 2021, the report said. The percentage of managers in the ‘A’ band has fallen from 33% in 2021 to 18% in 2023.
“Without asset managers being on board and helping to support the climate transition, there is very little hope of greening the world,” said Jackson from London CIV.
“If asset managers are not cognisant of that, and recognising that they not only need to influence, but prepare and be more climate resilient, then clearly there’s something wrong within their climate strategy.”",https://www.esginvestor.net/asset-managers-not-supporting-climate-policy/,economy and finances

An updated loss estimate will be available on Feb. 6, 2024.","The third loss estimate for the Kahramanmaras Earthquake Sequence, which hit large parts of south-central Turkey and neighboring Syria on Feb. 6, 2023, has risen to $3.4 billion, according to PERILS, the independent Zurich-based organization that provides industry-wide catastrophe insurance data. Based on claims data collected from affected insurance companies, PERILS’ third estimate of the insured property market loss for the Kahramanmaras Earthquake Sequence is 92.8 billion Turkish lira (approximately US$4.9 billion at February 2023 exchange rates and US$3.4 billion at the current exchange rate). The figure compares to the previous PERILS estimates of TRY86.4 billion, issued three months after the event, and TRY65.4 billion, issued six weeks after the event. The numbers detail losses from the property line of business. In terms of insured losses, the earthquake is the costliest catastrophe event in Turkey’s history, PERILS said, noting that losses from other lines of business and losses from Syria are not included in the PERILS’ estimates. “At current exchange rates, TRY92.8 billion translates to approximately US$3.4 billion or €3.1 billion. However, in February 2023 when the earthquakes struck, TRY92.8 billion equated to approximately US$4.9 billion or €4.6 billion,” commented Luzi Hitz, CEO of PERILS. “Currency fluctuation is one example of the many challenges facing the Turkish insurance market as it continues to successfully process an unprecedent number of insurance claims from this event,” he added. The loss information in this third report provides a breakdown of property losses by province (low-resolution CRESTA Zones), with the data further divided by residential and commercial lines, and loss amounts split into buildings, contents and business interruption losses. PERILS said the dataset serves as a valuable benchmark to compare modeled losses with actual losses and thus facilitates the calibration of catatastrophe models for Turkish earthquake risk. In line with the PERILS’ reporting schedule, an updated estimate of the market loss from the earthquake will be made available on Feb. 6, 2024, 12 months after the event date. PERILS described the February earthquake sequence as follows: “The Kahramanmaras Earthquake Sequence consisted of three major earthquakes measuring Mw 7.8, Mw 6.7 and Mw 7.5 on the moment magnitude scale. They occurred along the south-western end of the East Anatolian fault system and caused extreme ground shaking in south-central Turkey and north-western Syria. The affected region is highly seismically active, sitting at the triple-junction between the Anatolian, Arabian and African tectonic plates. The East Anatolian Fault is a 700 kilometers long, northeast-southwest network of strike-slip faults that separate the Anatolian micro-plate to the north from the Arabian plate to the south, accommodating the westward extrusion of Turkey into the Aegean Sea.” More than 59,000 people lost their lives, and an estimated 3 million people were displaced. Official government figures put the cost of direct physical damage at TRY1.6 trillion and indirect economic costs at TRY350 billion. About PERILS The PERILS Industry Exposure & Loss Database is available to all interested parties via annual subscription. The database contains industry property sums insured and event loss information on a CRESTA zone level and per property line of business. PERILS industry loss estimates can be used as triggers in insurance risk transactions such as industry loss warranty contracts (ILW) or insurance-linked securities (ILS). The service currently covers the following 18 countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. In addition, PERILS industry exposure data are available for Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand.

70669,09-08-2023 02:32,7723771,Farmers Limits New California HO Policies; Insurer Group Calls for Reform,"Farmers Insurance will restrict new homeowners insurance policies in California, following similar moves by State Farm and other major carriers. The decision comes as carriers grapple with record-breaking inflation, severe weather events, and rising reconstruction costs. The American Property Casualty Insurance Association (APCIA) has called for a reform of California's primary insurance law, Proposition 103, which requires carriers to get prior approval from the California Department of Insurance before implementing property/casualty insurance rates. APCIA's move follows carriers' withdrawal from California due to risks from wildfires, inflation, and pricing issues. Industry players have called for tools to manage catastrophic risk, criticizing California's outdated regulatory regime.","Farmers will limit new homeowners insurance policies in California, according to a statement issued by the carrier. The move follows a similar decision by State Farm last month and adds to a growing list of major carriers cooling on California. “We are working diligently with the California Department of Insurance and others interested in improving the availability of property insurance in the state,” the statement reads. “With record-breaking inflation, severe weather events, and reconstruction costs continuing to climb, we are focused on serving our customers while effectively managing our business. Effective July 3, Farmers will limit new homeowners insurance policies in California to a level consistent with the volume we projected to write each month before recent market changes.” On the heels of the announcement, the American Property Casualty Insurance Association issued a call to reform California’s primary insurance law following another large insurance carrier limiting new homeowners insurance writing in California. The APCIA is seeking to reform Proposition 103, a law passed by voters in 1988 that requires carriers to get prior approval from the California Department of Insurance before implementing property/casualty insurance rates. Prop 103 outlines factors in ratings. The APCIA’s call for reform comes as several carriers have pulled back from California. A report out in June from Gallagher Re shows the threat of damaging wildfires in conjunction with inflation and pricing challenges has led to a distressed insurance and reinsurance market , particularly in California. (Related article: Strategic Portfolio Management Needed to Address Wildfire Risk ) State Farm General Insurance Co. announced at the end of May that it had stopped accepting new policy applications for property/casualty insurance in California for reasons including increased risks from wildfires and inflation. The decision followed a similar move by Allstate Corp. last year. Other large carriers that have announced a reduced appetite for writing California homeowners insurance include AIG and Chubb. “Insurers do not want to retrench from one of the nation’s most important markets, but cannot continue to operate and protect policyholders when insurers are struggling to secure an adequate rate and manage their risk exposure,” David A. Sampson, APCIA’s president and CEO, said in a statement released on Friday. He said the problems with the “outdated regulatory scheme” creates challenges, which have combined with other factors that have “led to the implosion of the California insurance market.” Those factors include one of the most prolonged and severe droughts in the Western U.S. in recorded history, historic wildfires in 2017, 2018, and 2020, high inflation and supply-chain disruption. and legal system abuse. “This means insurers need tools to manage catastrophic risk and California’s outdated regulatory regime is not providing those tools,” Sampson said. “Insurers are committed to California, and we look forward to working with the California Department of Insurance and policymakers to enact real solutions so the Golden State can have a functioning and thriving insurance marketplace that benefits policyholders.” A spokesperson for the California Department of Insurance, Michael Soller, said Farmers is one of more than 100 companies continuing to write new homeowners business in California. “Californians are covered,” Soller said in an email responding to a request for comment. “They continue to have many choices including Farmers. The Department of Insurance understands Farmers has been writing 7,000 monthly new homeowners policies on average. So this is not a departure. We do not expect their footprint in the state to change significantly one way or another. By maintaining its historic average of new homeowners policies in California, Farmers is showing its continued commitment to the Golden State for the long haul.” APCIA’s statement calling for reform argues that California insurance marketplace solutions should include: - Allowing the use of catastrophe modeling in rate filings. - Allowing the use of reinsurance in ratemaking. - Reforming the rate filing process to complete reviews within statutory timeframes. - Reforming the California FAIR Plan assessment process. - Advocating for expanded wildfire mitigation to reduce the risk and make coverage more available in high-risk areas. “California’s regulatory framework (i.e., Proposition 103) is 35 years old and is ill-equipped to handle the increasing challenges wrought by climate change, and is resulting in the insurance market upheaval California faces today. It is time to modernize Proposition 103,” Sampson said. This article was originally published by Insurance Journal. Reporter Don Jergler is the West Coast editor of Insurance Journal.

70664,09-08-2023 02:31,7723762,Europe's Record Gas Inventories Cap Prices: Kemp,"Europe's gas inventories are at a record high due to the carryover from last winter, despite a slow refill since April caused by falling prices. As of August 6, stocks in the EU and the UK had risen to 998 terawatt-hours (TWh), with storage facilities over 87% full, compared to a 10-year average of 71%. Futures prices for gas delivered in summer 2023 have significantly decreased to boost consumption by industrial users and power generators. However, due to storage capacity limitations, these summer inventories are not an adequate substitute for winter 2023/24 imports, which could quickly deplete if the winter is colder than normal.","Europe's record gas inventories cap prices: Kemp
LONDON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Europe's gas inventories are at a record high for the time of year - the lingering effect of a record carryout from last winter, despite a relatively slow refill since the start of April driven by a fall in prices.
Stocks in the European Union and the United Kingdom had climbed to 998 terawatt-hours (TWh) by Aug. 6, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe (""Aggregated gas storage inventory"", GIE, Aug. 8).
Inventories were +234 TWh (+31% or +1.89 standard deviations) above the prior 10-year seasonal average and the surplus has narrowed only modestly from +282 TWh (+81% or +2.43 standard deviations) on March 31.
Stocks have risen by just +364 TWh since the end of the traditional winter season on March 31, the smallest increase since 2021 and before that 2014.
But because inventories finished the winter of 2022/23 at a record high even a smaller-than-average accumulation has left them at record levels.
As a result, storage facilities are already more than 87% full compared with a prior 10-year average of just 71% on the same date.
Based on seasonal fill rates over the last decade, stocks are on course to peak at 1,199 TWh before winter with a probable range of 1,102 TWh to 1,272 TWh.
Since maximum storage capacity is only around 1,142 TWh many of these trajectories are physically impossible and inventory additions will have to slow even further.
Futures prices for gas delivered in the summer of 2023 have already fallen sharply to encourage more consumption by industrial users and power generators.
Lower prices in Europe will also ensure more liquefied natural gas (LNG) is directed to price sensitive customers in Asia and Latin America.
After adjusting for inflation, front-month futures prices averaged less than 30 euros per megawatt-hour in July down from an average of 66 euros in January 2023 and a record 247 euros in August 2022.
Prices for gas delivered in October 2023 are also trading at a discount of 9 euros to November 2023 and almost 14 euros to April 2024 to encourage more use in the short term.
Since 2011, gas storage has continued filling until around Oct. 26 on average before starting to draw down for the winter.
But the sharp discount for prices in October should encourage an earlier peak and earlier start to depletion than normal to prevent storage space running out.
Since the end of June, traders have become less concerned about storage running out, with front-month prices steadying and pre-winter discounts actually narrowing slightly.
Prices for deliveries next year have also steadied with the calendar average for 2024 trading around 50 euros since March after slumping by two-thirds since August 2022.
Because of the limitations on storage capacity, inventories accumulated during the summer of 2023 are not a perfect substitute for imports during winter 2023/24.
Inventories will deplete and supplies tighten quickly if the winter is much colder than normal, leaving the region vulnerable to price spikes.
Even without price spikes, prices remain well above the pre-invasion average and are expected to remain high throughout 2024, discouraging industrial use and restart of major gas-intensive plants.
For the time being, however, inventories remain plentiful and the focus is on limiting further accumulation before the end of October.

The family-owned company and its 700 employees support nonprofits including food banks, mentoring programs, housing assistance, and child advocacy groups, donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to Texas charities annually. The company also strives to maintain a high level of engagement with nonprofits through volunteerism and sponsorships. Recently, the family received the inaugural Mildred and Oscar Ehrenberg Holocaust Memorial Museum Humanitarian Award for their work against hatred. The company emphasizes the value of community involvement and giving back.","Pape-Dawson Engineers’ Family Owners and Employees Build Better Communities
For nearly 60 years, Pape-Dawson Engineers Inc. has provided civil engineering, environmental and surveying support to thousands of projects that have improved numerous community footprints.
But its family owners also have sought to contribute to those communities in other ways through their own philanthropy and through what they have inspired of others, including Pape-Dawson’s charitable foundation and the firm’s 700 employees in their volunteer efforts (see photo below). Nonprofit organizations—from food banks and mentoring programs to housing assistance and child advocacy groups—have been key beneficiaries. Last year, Pape-Dawson also raised and donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to charities across Texas.
The company, with eight Texas offices, was selected last year as ENR Texas & Louisiana Design Firm of the Year. “We try to maintain a high level of engagement with nonprofits in our markets through volunteerism and sponsorships, and we established the foundation to help funnel employees’ direct donations to make a significant impact to the operations of these organizations,” Mark Ramseur, Pape-Dawson managing principal in central Texas, said in the 2022 ENR company profile. “Firmwide, we are relentlessly focused on bettering the communities we live and work in.”

That filters from the top. “If all we do is go to work and put projects on the ground, we are not successful. We must give back to our community and inspire others to do the same,” says Sam Dawson, CEO of Pape-Dawson and a second-generation family owner.
The family has recently turned its attention to combating the growth of hatred in the U.S. “The problem of injustice, anger and intolerance is not a political issue, it’s a heart issue,” Dawson says. “We need to spend a lot less time worrying about the politics of people and more time focused on the hearts of people.”
For its efforts to spread that message, the family recently was the inaugural recipient of the Mildred and Oscar Ehrenberg Holocaust Memorial Museum Humanitarian Award, given by the San Antonio Holocaust Memorial Museum. Those honored included (in photo above, left to right) Dawson’s parents Mary Duane Dawson and Gene Dawson Sr., Gene Jr., who is company president, and wife Claire, Laura Dawson and husband Sam Dawson).
“The Dawsons exemplify the values of living a life of honesty, integrity and responsibility,” Leslie Davis Met, museum director, told ENR. “They believe in the importance of fighting injustice and unfairness, leading by example and creating a legacy of being upstanders.”
For the Dawsons, this is a tradition instilled by Mary Duane and Gene Sr. since Pape-Dawson started in 1965.
“Community involvement and giving back has always been core to my family, and we’ve been careful to maintain a strong focus on that in all facets of our lives, including the company,” says Sam Dawson. “While staying in the black is vital to its survival, showing gratitude is just as important.”
Gene Jr. adds “it has been our honor to support the important work of charitable, civic and cultural organizations for almost six decades. We are extremely proud of the impact these partnerships have made, but there is still work to do.”
Texas Road Job Digs Up 19th-Century Artifacts
When the Texas Dept. of Transportation decided to widen Denton County’s Farm-to-Market Road 455, it appeared to be a straightforward project. That changed during initial environmental study when project team members began finding 19th-century artifacts.
Walking along the project’s right-of-way, agency staffers—having already researched the location’s history—performed tests with shovels and a backhoe to examine the site. Through numerous shovel tests, TxDOT found numerous small relics and verified the site as the location of the historic Sartin Hotel, which operated in the 19th century.
“Based on our findings, the next step was to conduct a small-scale excavation, which is when we discovered the hotel’s foundation,” says Travis Campbell, director of transportation planning and development for the agency’s Dallas district. That excavation confirmed the site’s significance, he says, “so we conducted a full-scale data recovery excavation.” That effort unearthed the location of an old blacksmith shop across the road through buried iron artifacts found in shovel tests, with their historical significance verified (see photo).
TxDOT now has teamed with archaeologists from consulting firm Stantec to unearth the artifacts that once were part of a Black-owned blacksmith shop, including tools, horse and mule shoes and a ceramic smoking pipe. Doug Boyd, Stantec senior archaeologist, said this is the first excavation of such a 19th-century blacksmith shop in Texas. The family of the owner, a former slave named Tom Cook who was freed in 1865 and died in 1898, has lived in Denton County for more than 150 years. Cook purchased a blacksmith shop in Bolivar, a once-thriving frontier town along the Chisholm Trail. Boyd said family and community members helped capture new knowledge and perspectives about the area’s past. “This isn’t a story you find in any history book,” he said.",https://www.enr.com/articles/56908-texas-and-louisiana-on-the-scene-august-2023,social issue

UPS reached a tentative five-year deal for some 340,000 U.S. employees represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union shortly before the July 31 expiration of their contract.","United Parcel Service UPS-N cut its full-year revenue and profitability targets on Tuesday as the world’s largest package deliverer faces higher labour costs and fights to win back U.S. business lost during tumultuous contract talks with the Teamsters. UPS reached a tentative five-year deal for some 340,000 U.S. employees represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union shortly before the July 31 expiration of their contract. In the run-up to the deal, as the union threatened to strike, customers diverted more shipments than expected to rivals, UPS CEO Carol Tome said on a conference call with analysts.
Rival FedEx required that shippers ramp up volume ahead of the UPS contract expiration in order to guarantee deliveries during a potential strike.
UPS customers shifted about 1 million packages per day to other providers, resulting in about $200 million of lost sales. Data suggests the U.S. Postal Service, FedEx and regional rivals each picked up about one-third of that business, Tome said.
“It’s all hands on deck to get back the volume that was diverted as a result of the negotiations,” she said, adding that the company expects to complete that effort by the end of 2023.
Atlanta-based UPS also grappled with business losses in previous contract negotiations. Much of that is expected to return because customers want to take advantage of volume discounts.
Voting by employees on whether to ratify the handshake labour agreement wraps up on Aug. 22. The deal includes wage hikes, ends a two-tier wage system for delivery drivers, adds one paid holiday and begins installing air conditioning in new delivery trucks next year. UPS retained flexibility for weekend service, temporary holiday workers and technology adoption.
UPS forecast annual consolidated revenue to be about $93 billion in 2023, down from a prior view of about $97 billion, and said it expected adjusted operating margin this year of around 11.8%, compared with an earlier forecast of about 12.8%.
Shares of UPS were down about 1.0% in mid-afternoon trading, while FedEx shares were up about 2%.
UPS said it would detail labour costs from the deal after it is ratified by employees.
UPS, often seen as a bellwether for the U.S. economy, and other logistics companies are facing a global shipping demand slump from soft e-commerce and weak export and industrial production that has squeezed margins.
The company reported adjusted profit of $2.54 per share for the second quarter, beating market expectations by 4 cents per share. Revenue fell about 11% and missed estimates of $23.1 billion, as per Refinitiv data.
The quarterly profit beat “underscores continued strong execution by UPS,” Fadi Chamoun, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said in a client note. Nevertheless, Chamoun said the forecast revision calls for “a very meaningful step down in profitability” that has potential negative implications for 2024 and 2025.
To shield its profit, UPS slashed costs and focused on moving high-margin parcels for health care and other businesses.
Its U.S. division, which accounted for 58% of adjusted operating profit in the second quarter, cut labour hours by almost 10% and lowered its management head count by 2,500. It also reduced flights by moving more air volume into its Worldport hub in Louisville, Kentucky, and improved efficiency by shifting package flows from smaller non-automated buildings to larger automated facilities.
“We will stay on strategy to capture growth in the most attractive parts of the market,” Tome said.",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/international-business/article-ups-cuts-revenue-view-on-lower-e-commerce-demand-new-labour-contract/,"labour, economy and finances"

(HPE) has been focusing on the unification of data within hybrid cloud, a vital aspect of which involves edge connectivity. Jason Newton, VP of integrated marketing, events and messaging at HPE, highlighted the increasing importance of unifying the user experience and data to provide the right resources. HPE has also been acquiring AI and analytics companies to enhance its capabilities, with recent acquisitions including Pachyderm and Determined.ai Inc. Newton stressed that alongside technology acquisitions, bringing in new talent is equally significant to the company's strategy.","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. was one of the first to steer the edge computing and hybrid cloud bandwagon years ago.
Now, the discourse has shifted to the unification of data within hybrid cloud to account for the different data personas and inherent technologies, such as artificial intelligence.
“You can’t do hybrid without edge connectivity securely — y ou would have an incomplete hybrid cloud or a cloud by accident,” said Jason Newton (pictured), vice president of integrated marketing, events and messaging at HPE. “Once you have those two elements, you can now start to unify the experience, but most importantly, unify the data and start to bring the right resources to the data.”
Newton recently spoke with theCUBE industry analysts Dave Vellante and Rob Strechay at HPE Discover , during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed some unfolding hybrid cloud trends from the end-user perspective and HPE itself. (* Disclosure below.)
Selling outcomes rather than products HPE’s ideology is implementing features that tackle specific cloud problems being faced by the majority of users, two of which are in the areas of observability and AIOps. Subsequently, the company hopes to become indispensable to organizations through problems solved rather than merely selling products, according to Newton.
“Now I’m selling the opportunity or I’m selling the problem we solve — I’m not selling the thing anymore,” he explained. “And it’s a much more strategic conversation that leads in a lot more directions, where if you come in with a product, it’s usually a yes or no.”
There have also been strategic acquisitions from HPE in a bid to bolster its AI and analytics capabilities; two such examples are the machine learning pipeline automation tool Pachyderm and Determined.ai Inc., which is an open-source platform for training deep learning models.
“We did Pachyderm , we did Determined AI, and now we have OpsRamp,” Newton said. “With HPE GreenLake, [we’re able to] have not only edge conversations and traditional private cloud conversations, but now we’re starting to talk about analytics workflows. We’re starting to take a look at workflows across the entire environment.”
But more than just acquiring technologies, there’s also the absorption of new talent to accompany it — which is just as important, Newton added.

The plant is part of a broader European Union initiative, the European Chips Act, which aims to double the continent's chipmaking capacity by 2030. Germany, which has sought to attract the world's largest contract chipmaker since 2021, will contribute $5 billion to the Dresden-based factory. This investment represents the largest in Saxony's history, and the factory is expected to create around 10,000 jobs. TSMC will own 70% of the plant, with Germany's Bosch and Infineon, and the Netherlands' NXP each owning 10%.","Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC on Tuesday committed 3.5 billion euros ($3.8 billion) to a factory in Germany, its first in Europe, taking advantage of huge state support for the $11 billion plant as the continent seeks to bring supply chains closer to home. The plant, which will be TSMC’s third outside of traditional manufacturing bases Taiwan and China, is central to Berlin’s ambition to foster the domestic semiconductor industry its car industry will need to remain globally competitive. The European Union has approved the European Chips Act, a 43 billion euro subsidy plan to double its chipmaking capacity by 2030, in a bid to catch up with Asia and the United States after shortages and high prices during the COVID-19 pandemic created havoc for the continent’s carmakers and machine builders. Germany, which has been courting the world’s largest contract chipmaker since 2021, will contribute up to 5 billion euros to the factory in Dresden, capital of the eastern state of Saxony, German officials said. “Germany is now probably becoming the major location for semiconductor production in Europe,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said, less than two months after Intel announced a 30 billion euro plan to build two chip-making plants in the country. “That is important for the resilience of production structures around the world, but it is also important for the future viability of our European continent, and it is of course particularly important for the future viability of Germany.” Saxony, center of the former East Germany’s electronics industry, already has several chip “fabs” and is heir to a tradition of precision craftsmanship: in one of the 40 rounds of talks, officials from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) were treated to a visit to see exquisitely wrought jewelry in Dresden’s Green Vault museum. TSMC’s is the single largest investment in Saxony’s history and a boost for conservative state premier Michael Kretschmer, who faces a strong challenge from the anti-immigration, far-right Alternative for Germany party ahead of next year’s regional election. Vote of confidence “This will only work if Germany becomes an immigrant country,” Kretschmer told a news conference, acknowledging that filling the 10,000-odd vacancies that would be created by the factory and its suppliers would take more than the investments in training that he was also planning. TSMC said it would invest up to 3.499 billion euros into a subsidiary, European Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (ESMC), of which it will own 70%. Germany’s Bosch and Infineon and the Netherlands’ NXP will each own 10% of the plant, which will make up to 40,000 wafers a month for cars and industrial and home products when it opens in 2017. The factory will cost around 10 billion euros in total. Semiconductor maker Wolfspeed too has already taken advantage of the subsidies on offer to set up shop in Germany, as the EU seeks to double to 20% its global market share in semiconductors by 2030. German Economy Minister Robert Habeck hailed the investment as a vote of confidence in a German economy that has been battered by high energy prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which triggered a slowdown and fears that Europe’s economic powerhouse could be deindustrialising. “There is going to be a real ecosystem for semiconductor manufacturing in Germany,” he said. “It’s going to generate orders for the whole sector: for machine builders, for optics manufacturers, for skilled workers.” TSMC is also investing $40 billion in a new plant in the western US state of Arizona, supporting Washington’s plans for more chipmaking at home, and is building a plant in Japan in a joint venture with Sony.

70641,09-08-2023 02:27,7723733,Custom Yashma Ransomware Crashes Into the Scene,"A new threat actor, suspected to be of Vietnamese origin, is using a custom variant of the Yashma ransomware to target English-speaking countries, Bulgaria, China, and Vietnam. Researchers at Cisco Talos discovered the actor utilizing a unique method to store and deliver the ransom note, which evades detection by endpoint solutions and antivirus software. The ransomware demands payment in Bitcoin, doubling the fee if not paid within three days. The actor's GitHub account and ransom notes are provided in multiple languages, indicating potential future targets. The ransomware resembles the WannaCry campaign, likely to mislead investigators.","A new threat actor that appears to be of Vietnamese origin has emerged wielding a custom version of the Yashma ransomware that's poised to hit targets in various English-speaking countries, Bulgaria, China, and Vietnam.
Researchers from Cisco Talos discovered the as-yet-unknown actor deploying a variant of Yashma in a campaign characterized by uniquely evasive ways to store and deliver its ransom note that they believe began in early June, they revealed in a blog post published Aug. 7.
Yashma is a 32-bit executable written in .NET and a rebranded version of Chaos ransomware version 5. The variant deployed by the new actor maintains most of its original features, with the exception of a few notable modifications, one of which is a new way to store and deliver the ransom note, the researchers said. The note also has shades of the one used by the notorious WannaCry ransomware.
""Usually, ransomware stores the ransom note text as strings in the binary,"" Chetan Raghuprasad, a Cisco Talos cybersecurity researcher, wrote in the post. ""However, this variant of Yashma executes an embedded batch file, which has the commands to download the ransom note from the actor-controlled GitHub repository.""
This technique evades endpoint detection solutions and antivirus software, which typically detect embedded ransom note strings in the binary.
Further, the actor demands the ransom payment in Bitcoins to a wallet address and the fee is doubled if the victim fails to pay within three days, according to the researchers' analysis. Victims also can contact the actor at "" [email protected] ,"" one of several clues that point to the actor's origin as Vietnam.
The actor maintains a GitHub account as ""nguyenvietphat,"" which spoofs a legitimate Vietnamese organization's name, and the note asks victims to contact them during a time that's convenient for Vietnam's time zone.
At the time of the researchers' analysis, the ransomware operation seems to be in its early stages, as there was no Bitcoin in the wallet and the note didn't specify an amount to be paid. However, the researchers found ransom notes written in English, Bulgarian, Vietnamese, simplified Chinese, and traditional Chinese in the actor's GitHub files, which indicates potential future targets.
Further, the ransom note text resembles the one used in the massive WannaCry ransomware campaign of 2017, potentially to hide the identity of the threat actor and throw investigators off the trail, the researchers said.
What's in, What's Out Yashma first surfaced in May 2022 as a full-fledged ransomware module in the Chaos malware-builder , which itself emerged as a wiper from the criminal underground before morphing into a Swiss Army knife for hackers. Aside from how it presents its ransom note, the variant also has a few other differences to the principal version of Yashma.
One modification is how it establishes persistence on a machine. Earlier versions of Yashma ransomware established persistence in the Run registry key and by dropping a Windows shortcut file pointing to the ransomware executable path in the startup folder. The variant also does the former but then creates a "".url"" bookmark file in the startup folder that points to the dropped executable located at ""%AppData%\Roaming\svchost.exe,"" the researchers noted.
The variant also is notable for what it maintains from the original code, which is Yashma's anti-recovery capability that once it encrypts files, wipes the contents of the original unencrypted files, writes just one character — “?"" — and then deletes the file, Raghuprasad said.
""This technique makes it more challenging for incident responders and forensic analysts to recover the deleted files from the victim's hard drive,"" he wrote in the post.
Defense Strategies The researchers included a link to indicators of compromise so organizations can check their systems to see if they've been affected.
Organizations also can secure their networks from ransomware by using various secure endpoint, web appliance, and email solutions, the last of which are particularly important as ransomware often enters an enterprise system via a phishing or email based attack.
Network firewalls, malware analytics, and secure Internet gateways that block users from connecting to malicious elements can also help protect organizations from ransomware and other types of malware.

70635,09-08-2023 02:26,7723719,Why do Businesses Want Private Networks? It's Simpler than you Think. - RCR Wireless News,"Enterprises are primarily interested in adopting private networks for their increased security and network reliability, according to a survey commissioned by Spirent Communications and conducted by STL Partners. The survey, which included about 200 businesses from various sectors and sizes, showed that these attributes are seen as fundamental requirements for implementing any mission-critical use case. The report also highlighted the growing importance of service-level agreement management and significant concerns around data sovereignty and IP. However, the conversation around private networks should be linked to business outcomes, such as increased uptime and risk reduction.","A new survey of enterprises interested in adopting private networks lays out two primary reasons that they want to do so—and it’s not driven by vertical-specific, high-performance use cases. Instead, they see the primary value of private networks as providing increased security and network reliability. “While maybe we thought in advance that they might be thinking of a new business case or some types of specific savings, in reality, by a large percentage, increased security and network reliability stood out,” said Stephen Douglas, head of market strategy for Spirent Communications, which commissioned the survey conducted by STL Partners. “They saw these capabilities as fundamental table stakes to enable any kind of real, mission-critical use case that they wanted to achieve,” Douglas explained. “If they didn’t have this level of increased security, if they didn’t have guaranteed network reliability, many use cases they were looking to implement or adopt simply couldn’t be done.” In other words, enterprises want to be certain that new private networks will actually provide a reliable and safe network usage environment, before they’ll jump into more advanced uses of such networks. The new report is based on a survey of around 200 enterprises of various sizes, conducted late last year by STL Partners. Douglas said that the survey was prompted by Spirent’s service provider customers, who were seeking “a detailed understanding of what enterprises would be looking for in terms of use cases, SLA requirements around private networks,” specifically in the sectors of finance, oil and gas, transportation and logistics and manufacturing—which are seen as the most advanced in terms of willingness to adopt private networks. Service providers, Douglas said, “were keen not to just speak to these large enterprises who maybe were likely to be adopting a private network, they wanted to understand what those smaller and medium-sized businesses were thinking as well, and if there’s a difference in the challenges and requirements that they might have.” Twenty percent of the survey respondents had between 50-249 employees. In addition to businesses seeing the primary value of private networks in reliability and better security, Douglas said that the survey also illustrated that service-level agreement (SLA) management is “becoming critical”. Douglas also noted that the survey reflected fairly significant concerns around data sovereignty and IP, related to both security and SLA management. “In many cases, the kind of private networks that they have tried to implement today or have looked at, it’s been really difficult for them to achieve stringent SLAs both on current public networks but also best-effort or ad hoc networks they’ve developed themselves, using maybe Wi-Fi and wireline technologies coupled together,” he said. However, Douglas added that the conversation around private networks needs to be tied to business outcomes, such as increased uptime, risk reduction or increased production volume, rather than network-specific KPIs. “It’s the business outcomes are really critical here, because there was a lack of understanding of what … network KPI tied to outcome,” he continued. “But if you could demonstrate to them how the network KPI related to reducing downtime or increased efficiency on the factory floor, they were willing to pay.” And in fact, pay a premium; and they were also most interested in a managed-service and opex models, due to a lack of in-house cellular expertise. This presents what Spirent categorized as an opportunity for “extreme automation” of network lifecycle and continuous network testing, in order to keep opex at a minimum. “Service providers pursuing this opportunity will need unprecedented automation and flexible service level management and testing to address the distinct needs of enterprise applications and use cases,” the report concluded. “Comprehensive and robust private network service level management is an essential tool to ensure business outcomes as planned. With this in place, a significant opportunity exists for MNOs and CSPs to monetize their investments in 5G,” said Spirent’s Marc Cohn, principal strategist for private networks. “However, as the survey shows, none of this is possible without a mature testing strategy in place and employed in the planning, development, and throughout the lifecycle of the solution.”",https://www.rcrwireless.com/20230808/private-networks/why-do-businesses-want-private-networks-its-simpler-than-you-think,economy and finances
70632,09-08-2023 02:24,7723708,Dish to Buy Echostar as Ergen’s TV Empire Shifts to Wireless -,"Dish Network Corp. has proposed an all-stock acquisition of satellite network operator EchoStar Corp., a company it previously owned, in a deal worth approximately $4 billion. The move is part of billionaire Charlie Ergen's strategy to transition his faltering pay-TV business into a wireless communications firm. The merger would reunite EchoStar with Dish, which had spun off the business in 2008. The deal will provide Dish with greater access to cash to fund its 5G development, following difficulties in obtaining financing from the debt market due to rising interest rates. EchoStar CEO Hamid Akhavan will lead the merged company, with Ergen serving as executive chairman.","(Bloomberg) -- Dish Network Corp. is proposing to buy EchoStar Corp., the satellite network operator it once owned, in an all-stock deal valued at about $4 billion as billionaire Charlie Ergen works to turn his struggling legacy pay-TV business into a wireless communications company.
Every share of EchoStar will be converted into 2.85 shares of Dish, representing a premium of 12.9% for EchoStar stockholders, according to a company statement issued Tuesday. Existing Dish investors will own about 69% of the merged company. Dish shares surged as much as 9% while EchoStar fell 2%.
The merger reunites EchoStar with its former parent, which spun off the business in 2008. While EchoStar’s shares have risen by almost 15% in the past 12 months, Dish shares have plunged nearly 60% amid investor concerns about its debt levels and its reliance on a shrinking base of satellite TV subscribers.
“This is purely a financial move, which will give Dish a little more help in the credit market,” said Roger Entner, an analyst with Recon Analytics.
Dish had been effectively cut off from the debt market and has a narrow window to address its capital structure. Credit analysts had estimated that Dish would need as much as $16 billion in new capital between 2024 and 2026 to cover spending, wireless costs and address upcoming debt maturities as it works to transform itself into a wireless data service provider and challenge the likes of Verizon Communications Inc., T-Mobile US Inc. and AT&T Inc.
The company announced in June that it met its mobile network buildout requirement and now covers more than 70% of the US population. The same month, Dish launched Boost Infinite, its nationwide mobile subscription service, with a competitive $25 a month unlimited data plan. Ergen has told investors that Boost Infinite will prove its value in the market and help address the company’s financial situation.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:
Its plan to merge with EchoStar would provide Dish with access to cash to advance its 5G buildout after Chairman Charlie Ergen’s plan to tap the debt markets for financing got derailed by rising interest rates. Ergen, who controls both companies, could gain access to EchoStar’s $1.9 billion in cash and nearly $265 million in free cash flow expected this year, based on consensus, assuming the deal is approved.

Ergen, who is chairman of the board of both Dish and EchoStar, said merging the two companies “strengthens our balance sheet.” In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, he also said the deal “lengthens our runway for the next couple years, but there’ll be more to do on that.”
EchoStar Chief Executive Officer Hamid Akhavan will lead the combined company, and Ergen will serve as executive chairman, according to the statement. Erik Carlson, the CEO of Dish and a 15-year veteran of the company, will step down when the transaction closes by the end of the year — another sign that Ergen wants to take Dish in a different direction.
“Everyone serves at the pleasure of Charlie Ergen,” Entner said.
EchoStar has $702 million in cash and $1.5 billion in debt as of June. The company provides satellite services including secure communications technologies through its Hughes Network Systems and EchoStar Satellite Services businesses, its website shows. Hughes’s Jupiter 3, the world’s largest commercial communications satellite, was launched into orbit last month by SpaceX’s most powerful operational rocket and will provide wireless internet connectivity over North and South America.
Dish shares rose 8% to $8.27 at 10:58 a.m. in New York Tuesday. The bonds surged on news of the deal: Dish’s 7.750% notes due 2026 rose 4.25 cents to 70 cents on the dollar as of 8:15 a.m., according to Trace data.
EchoStar’s board special committee was advised by Evercore Inc. while JPMorgan Chase & Co. advised Dish’s board special committee.

70629,09-08-2023 02:23,7723701,UK Think Tank Proposes Greater Ransomware Reporting From Cyberinsurance to Government,"The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a UK-based think tank, has explored the relationship between cyber insurance and ransomware attacks. Despite evidence that cyber insurance policies are used for higher ransom demands, RUSI states the idea that insured organizations are specifically targeted is exaggerated. The institute suggests linking insurance coverage to a firm's cybersecurity stance, which could potentially raise cybersecurity standards and make attacks more difficult. However, it acknowledges that the insurance industry lacks knowledge about which tools to incentivize and that cyber insurance has limited market penetration.","The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) is an independent UK think tank that has been in existence since 1831. It has examined the relationship between cyberinsurance and ransomware, and proposes greater reporting from victims to government, enforced through insurance policies.
Specifically, RUSI finds that ransomware is prevalent among malicious attackers because it is profitable, easy, and low risk. Cyberinsurance does not cause ransomware. “While there is evidence that cyber insurance policies exfiltrated during attacks are used as leverage in negotiations and to set higher ransom demands, the conclusion that ransomware operators are deliberately targeting organizations with insurance has been overstated.”
The report, Cyber Insurance and the Ransomware Challenge (
However, RUSI believes that the lack of a consistent advocated response to ransomware is a separate and distinct problem. It does not recommend a blanket ban on the payment of ransoms, but suggests that the UK government’s black-and-white position on ransom payments has created “a vacuum of assurance and advice on best practices for ransom negotiations and payments.”
It sees the role of cyberinsurance as “raising cybersecurity standards, which could make it more difficult to successfully compromise victims and increase costs for ransomware operators.” Ultimately, this would involve linking insurance coverage to insured’s cybersecurity posture through refusals and premiums. “Cyber insurance is currently one of the few market-based levers for incentivizing organizations to implement security controls and resilience measures.”
This is possibly an oversimplification: business survival, profit, and shareholders are also good cybersecurity incentives – and they are not necessarily connected to cyberinsurance. Furthermore, they do not result in cybersecurity requirements imposed by an external third party with its own separate profit motives.
RUSI recognizes two possible problems for its assertion. Firstly, the insurance industry doesn’t really know what tools it should incentivize (after all, the entire security industry has so far failed to solve the ransomware problem); and secondly, cyberinsurance still has low market penetration — certainly insufficient to affect the overall ransomware ecosystem.
The first problem is well-understood by cybersecurity professionals. Cybercriminals continuously adapt their tactics whenever defenders get close to a solution. For example, attackers have evolved ransomware from concentrating on data encryption to concentrating on date theft. This requires a shift of emphasis from incident response to incident prevention – and new insurance policies must continually change to reflect any different reality.
There is always a cat and mouse game between attackers and defenders, and in many ways, cybersecurity is largely playing catchup with the attackers. The problem for cyberinsurance is that it must strive to be and remain ahead of the attackers, when in reality it must play catchup with the defenders.
RUSI sees a way forward through increased cooperation between the insurance industry and government. “The cyberinsurance industry could be a valuable partner for the UK government through increased ransomware attack and payment reporting, sharing aggregated claims data, and distributing National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) guidance and intelligence to organizations,” it says, adding “The UK government’s light-touch approach is unsustainable and requires more intervention in private markets that are involved in ransomware prevention and response.”
It could be argued, however, that data sharing from the NCSC’s Early Warning service should be a given, and not reliant on a quid quo pro from industry.
RUSI makes nine specific recommendations in its report:
- Cyberinsurance policies should require that insureds and IR firms provide written evidence on ransom negotiations and their outcomes.
- To drive market-wide response best practices, insurers should define and use a set of response firms that meet pre-defined requirements.
- The government should assist in defining “common best practices and key market players, and create a framework for benchmarking the quality of their services and products.”
- To improve reporting on ransom payments, the government should explore a licensing regime for firms that facilitate cryptocurrency payments on behalf of victims. This should follow the US example, and the facilitators should be “subject to national financial crime reporting requirements”.
- Insurers should set ‘minimum conditions and obligations in ransomware coverage’ that enforce consideration of alternatives to ransom payment. “These should include sanctions due diligence, a requirement to notify law enforcement and written evidence that all options have been exhausted.”
- Insurers should require that coverage should require policyholders to inform both Action Fraud and the NCSC before any payment is made. If necessary, “regulators should intervene to compel insurers to include this obligation in coverage.” But it is not a one-way obligation. Law enforcement and the NCSC must give assurances “that reporting leads to actual outcomes against ransomware actors, such as cryptocurrency seizures, arrests or offensive cyber operations.”
- Integration of the NCSC’s Early Warning service into insurers’ policyholder assessments would allow the distribution of potential ransomware attack intelligence.
- The NCSC should strengthen operational collaboration by recruiting secondees from the insurance industry into the Industry 100 cyber security secondment scheme.
- The government and the National Crime Agency should ensure that suspicious activity reports (SARs) are fit for reporting ransom payments and associated money laundering, and “identify ways to encourage cyber insurers to report ransom payments as SARs or through more informal channels.”
The overall impression of the RUSI report is that increased cooperation from the cyberinsurance industry could help government response to the ransomware threat. There is little in these recommendations on how the cyberinsurance industry can help its insureds, beyond saying, ‘if you want insurance, this is the level of security you must implement’ (even if it doesn’t focus on the latest attacker methods).
RUSI’s basic proposals are effectively intrusive on both public and private industry, adding that, if necessary, the recommendations should be imposed by regulation. There is nothing in the basic recommendations to incentivize business into adopting ransomware cyberinsurance. This is no way to treat business. It may indeed have the opposite effect, persuading industry to forego ransomware insurance rather than give up its freedom of movement in doing its own job just to help the NCSC do its job.

The ransom note, downloaded from a GitHub repository, resembles the WannaCry ransomware note, potentially to obscure the actor's identity. The ransomware is a rebranded version of the leaked Chaos ransomware builder. The emergence of this ransomware follows a spike in attacks, with Malwarebytes recording 1,900 incidents over the past year. This increase is largely attributed to the Cl0p group's exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities.","An unknown threat actor is using a variant of the Yashma ransomware to target various entities in English-speaking countries, Bulgaria, China, and Vietnam at least since June 4, 2023.
Cisco Talos, in a new write-up, attributed the operation with moderate confidence to an adversary of likely Vietnamese origin.
""The threat actor uses an uncommon technique to deliver the ransom note,"" security researcher Chetan Raghuprasad said . ""Instead of embedding the ransom note strings in the binary, they download the ransom note from the actor-controlled GitHub repository by executing an embedded batch file.""
Yashma, first described by the BlackBerry research and intelligence team in May 2022, is a rebranded version of another ransomware strain called Chaos. A month prior to its emergence, the Chaos ransomware builder was leaked in the wild.
A notable aspect of the ransom note is its resemblance to the well-known WannaCry ransomware, possibly done so in an attempt to obscure the threat actor's identity and confuse attribution efforts. While the note mentions a wallet address to which the payment is to be made, it doesn't specify the amount.
The disclosure comes as the cybersecurity company said that leaks of ransomware source code and builders are leading to the acceleration of new ransomware variants, thereby resulting in more attacks.
""Ransomware builders usually have a user interface that allows users to choose the underlying features and customize the configurations to build a new ransomware binary executable without exposing the source code or needing a compiler installed,"" the company pointed out .
""The availability of such builders allows novice actors to generate their own customized ransomware variants.""
The development also follows a major spike in ransomware attacks, with Malwarebytes recording as many as 1,900 incidents over the past year within the U.S., Germany, France, and the U.K., mainly fueled by the ""ascension of the Cl0p group – which has effectively harnessed zero-day vulnerabilities to amplify its attacks.""
In a related report, Akamai found that an increase in the use of zero-day and one-day security flaws has resulted in a 143% increase in the number of ransomware victims in the first quarter of 2023 compared with the same period last year.
""The Cl0p ransomware group is aggressively developing zero-day vulnerabilities, growing its victims by 9x year over year,"" the company said . ""Victims of multiple ransomware attacks were more than 6x more likely to experience the second attack within three months of the first attack.""
But in what's a further sign of the evolution of the threat landscape, Trend Micro disclosed details of a TargetCompany (aka Mallox or Xollam) ransomware attack that utilized an iteration of a fully undetectable (FUD) obfuscator engine called BatCloak to infect vulnerable systems with remote access trojans like Remcos RAT and maintain a stealthy presence on targeted networks.
""Afterward, the Remcos RAT will resume its final routine as it downloads and deploys the TargetCompany ransomware still wrapped in an FUD packer,"" the company said .
""The use of FUD malware already limits most available solutions for this said tactic, even more so for off-the-shelf technologies likely susceptible to other attacks (not just ransomware). This set of packers will likely not be the only ones being developed in the near future.""",https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/new-yashma-ransomware-variant-targets.html,"crime, law and justice"

The Tata Group is in the final stages of announcing its battery cell partnership with Envision AESC, one of the world’s top battery technology companies, as it secures critical expertise to prepare itself for a net-zero future.","Envision AESC likely to be global battery supplier for Tata Group – AutocarPro.
The Tata Group is in the final stages of announcing its battery cell partnership with Envision AESC, one of the world’s top battery technology companies, as it secures critical expertise to prepare itself for a net-zero future.
Envision AESC, the Japan-headquartered global battery cell supplier, is the lead contender amongst a multitude of potential partners, including LG Chem, CATL and FinDreams, that the Tata Group has explored as part of its ‘Project Apollo’ over the past year.
Autocar Professional learns the new battery venture is likely to be steered by Tom Flack, the former sourcing head of Tata Motors who has been made in-charge of Tata Agratas, a specially formed battery cell manufacturing company. This project is likely to involve multi-billion dollars of investment and will be run by a separate arm, which may eventually bring private equity money to fund significant capacities.
To this effect, already the group has committed over 1.3 billion dollars in India for the cell manufacturing in India, which is likely to come up in Gujarat to cater to the needs of Tata Motors’ 10-product EV portfolio, which will be manufactured out of Sanand, Gujarat.
And in the United Kingdom, the Tata Group has already committed over 4 billion pounds of investment to set up a
40GW global battery cell gigafactory. The salt-to-software group is likely to invest over Rs 50,000 crore to Rs 70,000 crore before the end of the decade in battery manufacturing capacity.
The core of discussion with Envision AESC is around high-powered NMC cells for JLR, but the Group is also exploring solid state batteries. Sources say the discussion includes options from a licencing agreement to an equity partnership but the real structure of the association will only be known in the coming months.
As part of the study, the Tata Group has explored several chemistries — from LFP, NMC in prismatic and cylindrical form, and solid state technologies as well, It is understood that the Group is likely to have different solutions for India to power Tata Motors’ EV ambition and a different solution for JLR, which operates in the high-performance luxury car market against German rivals and also Tesla.
While an email sent to Envision AESC did not elicit any response till the time of publishing, the one sent to Tata Motors and Tata Sons drew a no- comments-on-market-rumours response.
Envision AESC: plugged in to global automakers
Though Envision is headquartered in Japan, the company has its roots in China with its promoter, founder and executive chairman Lei Zhang being a Chinese national. The Envision AESC Group operates battery production plants in Kanagawa and Ibaraki, Japan; Kentucky, South Carolina and Tennessee in the United States; Douai, France; Extremadura, Spain; Sunderland, UK (for Nissan); and four production bases in Jiangyin, Ordos, Shiyan, and Cangzhou, China along with an R&D centre in Shanghai.
In October 2022, Envision AESC had announced a new multi-year partnership with BMW Group to supply latest innovation battery cells for the global brand’s next-generation EVs. The likes of Mercedes-Benz and Groupe Renault are also some of its key customers.
The company website states that through AIoT-driven innovations in battery technology and multidisciplinary applications, Envision AESC establishes scenarios to enable EVs to participate in the renewable energy eco-system, and provides a dynamic balance to promote common development of clean energy and new energy electric vehicle industry.
The Group has even studied multiple EV segments, exploring the potential of catering to two- and three-wheelers other than the captive consumption for electric cars, SUVs and commercial vehicles. It is likely to also supply to other OEs to achieve scale for a strong business case and hence even the swappable solution as well as battery energy storage solutions have been explored.
Sources told Autocar Professional:
The company is likely to invest in different chemistries and cell formats to ensure it caters to a wider market.
“It is most likely planning to offer a bouquet of options to ensure the right solution for the right product and topography and weather patterns.”
Tata: Making the most of Group synergies
Akin to a number of global multinational corporations, Tata is attempting strong vertical integration within its Group companies,a move which will bring together the resources, expertise and technology of multiple Tata Group companies to create a comprehensive solution for the production and deployment of EVs.
This should see the likes of Tata AutoComp, Tata Technologies, Tata Consultancy Services, Tata Steel, Tata Power and Tata Chemicals amongst others play a pivotal role in helping the Group lead the EV transition in India and also be a serious player in the global automotive market with JLR in the future.
The ‘One Tata’ approach has been at the core of its foray in India, and the same is likely to be replicated in Europe, either in the UK or other overseas bases that it may create in the future to protect itself from global business volatility.

70605,09-08-2023 02:18,7723648,"European Commission Approves €1,5 Billion French Measure to Support Prologium in Researching and Developing Innovative Batteries for Electric Vehicles","European Commission approves €1,5 billion French measure to support ProLogium in researching and developing innovative batteries for electric vehicles. The European Commission has approved, under EU State aid rules, a €1.5 billion French measure to support ProLogium Technologies (‘ProLogium’) in researching and developing a new generation of batteries for electric vehicles.","European Commission approves €1,5 billion French measure to support ProLogium in researching and developing innovative batteries for electric vehicles.
The European Commission has approved, under EU State aid rules, a €1.5 billion French measure to support ProLogium Technologies (‘ProLogium’) in researching and developing a new generation of batteries for electric vehicles. The measure will contribute to the achievement of the strategic objectives of the
European Green Deal and the EU battery strategy.
The French measure
France notified to the Commission its plan to support ProLogium’s Prometheus research and development (‘R&D’) project of solid-state batteries (‘SSB’) for electric vehicles. SSB technology uses solid instead of liquid electrolyte to develop batteries that have a higher energy density and are safer for consumers than conventional lithium-ion batteries.
Under the measure, the aid will take the form of a direct grant of up to €1.5 billion that will cover the R&D project until the end of 2029.
As part of the Prometheus project, ProLogium will (i) develop ‘first generation’ SSB to overcome the limitations of the current lithium-ion batteries; (ii) develop ‘second generation’ SSB with enhanced energy density and sustainability; (iii) develop SSB recycling techniques and recycling strategies for various battery components; and (iv) contribute to the development of the standards for SSB recycling.
ProLogium has committed to actively share the technical know-how gained through the project with industry and academia.
The Commission’s assessment
The Commission assessed the measure under EU State aid rules, in particular Article 107(3)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (‘TFEU’), which enables Member States to support the development of certain economic activities subject to certain conditions, and the
Framework for State aid for research and development and innovation (‘RDI Framework’).
The Commission found that:
- The measure facilitates the development of an economic activity, in particular R&D activities for the development of a new generation of SSB technology for electric vehicles.
- The aid has an ‘incentive effect’, as the beneficiary would not carry out the investments in R&D activities for solid-state batteries without the public support.
- The measure is necessary and appropriate to promote the relevant R&D activities. In addition, it is proportionate, as the level of the aid corresponds to the effective financing needs.
- The measure has sufficient safeguards to ensure that undue distortions of competition are limited. In particular, if the project turns out to be very successful, generating extra net revenues, the beneficiary will return part of the aid received to France under a claw-back mechanism. Finally, ProLogium will disseminate the technical know-how gained through the project.
- The aid brings about positive effects that outweigh any potential distortion of competition and trade in the EU.
On this basis, the Commission approved the French measure under EU State aid rules.
Background
The
Communication on State aid rules for research, development and innovation (‘2022 RDI Framework’) sets out the rules under which Member States can grant State aid to companies for RDI activities, while ensuring a level playing field.
The RDI Framework aims at facilitating research, development and innovation activities, which, due to market failures, would not occur in the absence of public support. It enables Member States, subject to certain conditions, to provide the necessary incentives to companies and the research community to carry out these important activities and investments in this field.
The RDI Framework applies the principle of technological neutrality and thus relates to all technologies, industries and sectors to ensure that the rules do not prescribe in advance which research paths would result in new solutions for innovative products, processes and services.
The non-confidential version of the decision will be made available under the case number SA.106740 in the
State aid register on the Commission’s competition website once any confidentiality issues have been resolved. New publications of State aid decisions on the internet and in the Official Journal are listed in the Competition Weekly e-News.
Margrethe Vestager, Executive Vice-President in charge of competition policy said:
This €1.5 billion measure enables France to support ProLogium’s research and development project on innovative solid-state batteries for electric vehicles.
“This project will also contribute to fostering an innovative battery value chain for electric vehicles in Europe, while limiting possible distortions of competition.”

70593,09-08-2023 02:15,7723612,Digital Therapeutics Alliance Exec on Learning from Europe,"Sen. Jeanne Shaheen has proposed the Prescription for Digital Therapeutics Act, aiming to establish Medicare and Medicaid coverage for prescription digital therapeutics. The bill also seeks to establish a payment methodology via the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Megan Coder, policy chief of the Digital Therapeutics Alliance, supports the bill and advocates for additional regulation in this fast-growing sector. The sector, which uses software to deliver patient interventions, needs further clarification on its operating ecosystem. Currently, private payers are more likely to engage with digital therapeutics than public payers.","Earlier this year, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) introduced the Prescription for Digital Therapeutics Act, which would provide for Medicare and Medicaid coverage of prescription digital therapeutics and establish a payment methodology through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
The nascent digital therapeutics sector, which uses prescription and non-prescription software to deliver interventions to patients, has evolved significantly in the past few years. Megan Coder, chief policy officer and founding member of the Digital Therapeutics Alliance, joined Modern Healthcare to discuss why the industry group is lobbying for the legislation and why she sees additional regulation as a necessity.
Keep up with one the industry’s fastest growing sectors. Sign up for Digital Health Intelligence.
Digital therapeutics is still a fairly new sector: The alliance launched in 2017.  What is the reasoning behind categorizing a wellness product and an ingestible sensor—to name a few examples of the tools—under the same umbrella?
When we first launched the Digital Therapeutics Alliance, we needed to identify what a digital therapeutic is and create the methodology and the frameworks around that foundation for the industry. We’re realizing the need to further explain the ecosystem we operate within as it grows. Digital therapeutics operate within the entirety of the [healthcare] ecosystem, alongside products used for diagnosis, monitoring, wellness, clinical decision support and other needs.
You’re personally based in Europe, but the organization is largely focused on the U.S. market. How does that work when you’re attempting to lobby Congress?
The United States is a really big market. We know there’s a lot of attention to what it could be. So the potential for the U.S. market is huge. Our staff members are generally based in the United States. We are set up as a 501 (c)(6) organization in the United States. So, by that fact alone, we are a U.S.-based organization.
Right now, private payers are much more likely to engage with digital therapeutics, while the public payer segment has been much more challenging. Medicare doesn’t have a benefit category.
In Europe, I’m starting to see public payer systems begin to take this matter on. It’s happening in Asia as well. It has been fascinating to see such a different approach than what’s going on in the United States. While you are correct—the alliance’s focus is very much on the U.S.—I think it would be very one-sided if we didn’t have this comparison with what’s going on in the international community and [the opportunity to be] educated. The U.S. can import a lot of these ideas, while exporting a lot of their own practices too, so there’s bidirectionality to benefit from.
Not a Modern Healthcare subscriber? Sign up today.
Why is your group asking for additional regulation?
We are pushing for the appropriate level of regulation. In many cases, that is full regulation [of digital therapeutics] as a medical device.
It’s up to regulatory agencies, as we know, to determine the level of risk of each product and whether it is being submitted to a full regulatory review pathway. We also know [digital therapeutics] is a category of medicine. We know that it’s been used alongside of—or sometimes in place of—medications or in-person therapies. These technologies need to be seen as what they are: medical devices that are being used to impact patient disease states.
Regulation for digital therapeutics will likely be different than what’s going to be [appropriate] for pharmaceutical [products], but the same principles apply.
What’s your message to a skeptical hospital CEO or health system executive hesitant to adopt these technologies?
I would acknowledge to them that this is still likely a very challenging ecosystem to navigate. If you are new to this, I think the idea of knowing which products are the right ones to be looking at—which ones have the evidence, credibility, certifications and regulatory acceptance—can be very challenging.
The idea of a fit-for-purpose evaluation is critical too: Not just assuming digital therapeutics need to meet the exact same methodology and rigor of every single pharmaceutical that’s out there. Digital therapeutics have their own sets of rigor and trial designs appropriate to their style. So, it may not be a one-to-one identical relationship [from one therapeutic to another]. But it is important to be able to say: “Let’s look at what the study design is, what they’re trying to achieve, what they’ve accomplished, and what the rigor of this study is.”

The alliance recently released a guide to help define digital therapeutics. What happens next for that toolkit, the industry and your organization if the Access to Prescription Digital Therapeutics Act passes?
Our next phase is going to be making sure that the [toolkit] materials and things that we’ve created are delivering on their impact: That they have the credibility they need from payers’ and decision-makers’ perspectives, but also usability. So really, the next phase is dissemination and engaging with a wide variety of stakeholders to really make sure that impact is optimized.

70591,09-08-2023 02:15,7723607,South Africa: The Importance Of Having Proper Employment Contracts That Include A Focus On Restraint Of Trade Clauses - Consolidated Employers Organisation,"The article emphasizes the importance of comprehensive employment contracts in protecting business interests in the South African labour market. These contracts, particularly those featuring restraint of trade provisions, shield businesses from potential risks associated with departing employees, such as divulging trade secrets or working for competitors. These contracts should be tailored to suit specific industries and circumstances, with the enforceability of the clauses dependent on their reasonableness and adherence to public policy. The article recommends seeking legal advice when drafting these contracts to ensure compliance with laws and effective safeguarding of business interests.","As a business owner, protecting your business and its interests is paramount to ensuring long-term success in the competitive South African labour market. One of the crucial steps in achieving this goal is having comprehensive employment contracts in place. In this, the first article of our ""Mind Your Own Business"" series, we will explore the significance of proper employment contracts, with a particular focus on restraint of trade provisions – critical to protecting your business from potential risks posed by departing employees.
Employment contracts serve as the foundation of the employer-employee relationship. They set out the terms and conditions of employment, defining the rights and responsibilities of both parties. Properly drafted employment contracts provide clarity and legal protection, fostering a harmonious work environment and reducing the risk of disputes.
Restraint of trade agreements – one of the commercial considerations within employment contracts – are designed to safeguard your business interests through clauses that will restrict departing employees from engaging in activities that could harm your business, such as working for competitors, soliciting your clients, divulging trade secrets, or misusing confidential information.
Each business is unique, meaning that the employment contracts' restraint clauses should be tailored to suit your specific industry and circumstances to ensure that a protectable interest can be argued based on the prevailing facts, should it be required. Seeking legal advice when drafting these contracts can ensure that they comply with the applicable laws and effectively protect your business interests.
How enforceable will these clauses be? The enforceability of restraint of trade agreements lies in the reasonableness and adherence to public policy. Courts will assess whether the restrictions imposed on employees are justified based on the legitimate protectable interests of the employer. For example, an employer needs to reasonably and justifiably argue that an interest, as described in the restraint provisions, is worth protecting (such as the fact that a departing employee may have had access to trade secrets due to his/her position within the business), and that the employer will lose such protection should the employee join a new employer who will unlawfully gain an advantage – to the detriment of the erstwhile employer, as a result. So, by incorporating reasonable restraint of trade clauses, you can effectively protect your business from potential harm caused by departing employees.
For your business to remain competitive and secure within South Africa's labour market, the importance of well-constructed employment contracts, particularly those featuring restraint of trade agreements, cannot be overstated. These contracts serve as a legal shield, defining the obligations and rights of both employer and employee, and offering a way to lessen possible risks that might arise when employees leave. By including carefully crafted restraint of trade provisions in your contracts, you can maintain a competitive edge and robustly protect valuable assets such as intellectual property, trade secrets, and confidential information.

70590,09-08-2023 02:15,7723606,What Hospices Can Learn from Home Health Agencies on New Program Integrity Rules,"The U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is implementing new regulatory actions to strengthen hospice program integrity. These changes mirror those previously applied to home health providers, which proved effective in improving compliance and reducing unethical activity. CMS aims to curb the influx of new providers, particularly in California, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada, who are more focused on selling their licenses at a profit than patient care. The California Department of Justice highlighted the issue, noting that lax oversight has led to large-scale fraud and abuse. Calls for federal action have increased in response to these concerns.","Hospices seeking to gauge the potential impact of new regulatory actions in the space can look to their counterparts in the home health field.
The steps that the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has put forth to strengthen hospice program integrity mirror rules implemented in years past for home health providers, including medical review processes and rules for when a provider can sell their business.
Generally, when applied to home health, policies like these were effective at improving compliance and reducing unethical or illegal activity, according to Bill Dombi, president of the National Association for Home Health & Hospice (NAHC).
“There was a scramble first to understand them, and then there were efforts to try to find workarounds. And then there were efforts to comply. We then started seeing the greater degree of impact,” Dombi told Hospice News. “Providers sharpened their games relative to compliance for purposes of claims and quality of care, and then those people who were trying to get into the home health business without the best of intentions just disappeared.”
CMS is no doubt hoping for similar results for the Medicare Hospice Benefit.
The agency is working to curb the impact of a rash of new providers that have emerged so far in four states: California, Arizona, Texas and Nevada. A large contingent of these companies were established with the purpose of selling the license at a profit, with little concern for patient care.
Arizona had 239 new Medicare-certified hospices appear between 2018 and 2022, representing 52% of all providers in the state. In that time frame, Nevada saw 56 newly certified hospices, and 369 emerged in Texas.
In some instances, multiple hospices have been operating out of the same address without a corresponding increase in the population of eligible patients, according to the California Department of Justice (CDOJ). Some individuals also hold management positions at several of these hospices simultaneously.
The issue first garnered attention in California, where CDOJ
reported that lax hospice oversight had “created the opportunity for large-scale fraud and abuse,” and that it had identified “numerous indicators of such fraud and abuse by hospice agencies” statewide.
As it became apparent these similar concerns existed in other states, calls for federal action grew louder from providers, industry organizations and lawmakers.
“The vast majority of people in the industry are committed to the principles and the practice and the delivery. There are, in fact, some outliers. We’ve watched people who’ve just abused the system and compromised the protections and services that have been given to some of our most vulnerable people,” Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) told Hospice News. “There are people who are running hospice programs that are only theoretical. They’re not actually providing services to people, and they are bleeding money from the federal government.”
Thus far, the agency has proposed a rule that would require hospice owners to wait at least 36 months to sell their businesses after receiving Medicare certification. CMS has also taken some steps to make hospice ownership more transparent and plans to step up medical reviews of hospice claims.
The problem represents an opportunity for the hospice community to work with lawmakers to identify solutions, according to Ben Marcantonio, COO and interim CEO of the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO).
“One of the key things is really collaborating [with lawmakers] and coming to a real common understanding of what the concerns and issues are and what the solutions are,” Marcantonio told Hospice News. “With the program integrity area, would [CMS and legislators] take action with us on our recommendation around a moratorium in certain states, to get a focused, time-limited moratorium so that we don’t compromise access to care.”
In January, a coalition of industry groups sent
34 recommendations to CMS for improving program integrity, including NHPCO, NAHC, LeadingAge and the National Partnership for Healthcare and Hospice Innovation. Their recommendations included a temporary moratorium on new hospices enrolling in Medicare.
The earlier experiences of home health providers informed those recommendations as well.
“We borrowed from the experiences in home health with the proposals that we advanced the CMS including the 36-month rule, So if we see the hospice rules have an impact like the home health ones, then it will do its job,” Dombi said. “We would anticipate that the chances of that happening are high, even if it’s a little bit late, given what we’ve seen already occurring in California and some of the other states.”
The “36-month” rule forbids any change in majority ownership during the 36 months after initial Medicare certification, including acquisitions, stock transactions or mergers.
Hospices may benefit from the fact that CMS had some time to work out some of the kinks in the rule since implementing it for home health. In its first iteration, the 36-month rule for home health agencies was “a mess” that blocked some legitimate transactions, but it became “workable” following some revisions, Dombi said.
Additionally, CMS is conducting a small pilot program to test the waters on post-payment reviews of hospice stays that exceed 90 days. The agency has contracted with Noridian Healthcare Solutions, LLC as its Supplemental Medical Review Contractor (SMRC). Noridian will perform the reviews and submit findings to CMS.
“CMS internal data has identified a potential area of vulnerability beginning with the second benefit period, or 91st day in hospice,” Noridian indicated in an announcement. “The SMRC was tasked to perform data analysis and conduct medical record review activities.”
Noridian will review Part A hospice claims that were filed during the calendar year 2021. The SMRC will notify hospices under review with a statement of reasons, request for documentation as well as informational resources. In 2022, the projected improper payment amount for hospice care is expected to be close to $2.9 billion, a rate of 12%, Noridian indicated.
CMS is also developing “enhanced oversight” for providers in California, Nevada, Arizona and Texas. A key component of this includes a medical review of claims before a Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) will pay them.
The enhanced oversight period applies to hospices in those four states that are newly enrolled in the Medicare program as of July 13, as well as those who are submitting or undergoing a change in ownership.
While the impact of those changes will largely depend on how CMS executes them, the agency has stopped short of issuing the moratorium proposed by NAHC, NHPCO, NPHI and LeadingAge.
Under current law, the CMS has the authority to impose moratoria on certification but so far has balked at using it for hospice. The agency’s rationale is that it does not believe that it has the ability to make exceptions when a provider can demonstrate a need for an additional hospice in a particular community, Dombi said. Exceptions like these are included in the current state licensing moratorium in California.
This rationale is “perplexing,” according to Dombi.
“They didn’t have exceptions in home health either, and that didn’t seem to bother them back in the 1990s or later periods when they exercised that authority,” he said. “We think they have the ability to be laser-focused and say, ‘There will be no more home health agencies or no more hospices in the following zip codes,’” he said. “But right now they’re using the explanation that they don’t have the power to give somebody an exception when they could demonstrate need.”",https://hospicenews.com/2023/08/08/what-hospices-can-learn-from-home-health-agencies-on-new-program-integrity-rules/,health
70589,09-08-2023 02:15,7723605,atai Life Sciences Announces Positive Results From Phase 1 Bridging Study of PCN-101 - The Dales Report,"atai Life Sciences has reported positive results from its Phase 1 study of PCN-101 (R-ketamine), focusing on the transition from intravenous to subcutaneous delivery. The study aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of varying subcutaneous doses of PCN-101, comparing them against the established 60mg intravenous administration. The results showed favourable tolerability and no serious adverse events, suggesting potential for PCN-101 as a rapid-acting antidepressant suitable for home use. The company believes these findings compare favourably to the FDA-approved esketamine drug Spravato, laying the groundwork for future home-based therapeutic use of PCN-101.","atai Life Sciences Announces Positive Results From Phase 1 Bridging Study of PCN-101 atai Life Sciences (NASDAQ: ATAI) has unveiled findings from subsidiary Perception Neuroscience Phase 1 investigation into the intravenous-to-subcutaneous transition of PCN-101 (R-ketamine). The outlook of the safety-focused trial look promising for continuation of the trial. In this Phase 1 study, characterized by its open-label design and a comprehensive four-phase crossover structure, the emphasis was placed on evaluating the safety, tolerability, and intricate pharmacokinetic profile of varying PCN-101 doses (60mg, 90mg, and 120mg) delivered subcutaneously. These doses were compared against the established 60mg intravenous (IV) administration of PCN-101. To facilitate this exploration, a cohort of 16 healthy participants was selected and organized into four distinct administration sequences. The fundamental aim of this study was to glean insights into dosing strategies for each subcutaneous formulation, with a particular focus on optimizing the therapeutic index. This delicate equilibrium between safety, tolerability, and effectiveness holds the key to PCN-101’s potential as a rapid-acting antidepressant, designed for the convenience of at-home use. At the 60mg IV dose, instances of sedation and dissociation were congruous with the outcomes observed in previous PCN-101 investigations at equivalent dosages. Promisingly, the elevated 120mg SQ dosage registered sedation (determined by a MOAA/S1 score 4 and change from baseline >0) rates at 14% each. Most importantly, the administration of PCN-101 was met with favorable tolerability, devoid of any instances of serious adverse events. While acknowledging the constraints intrinsic to a study, atai Life Sciences believes that this safety and tolerability profile stands in favorable comparison to that of FDA-approved esketamine drug Spravato. Prior research has indicated sedation rates ranging from 50% to 61% and dissociation rates of 61% to 69%3 for Spravato. The rates of sedation and dissociation closely paralleled those documented in the placebo arms of the precedent Phase 2 inquiry into PCN-101 and the clinical assessments of Spravato in depression. Collectively, atai Life Sciences believes these findings lay the groundwork for contemplating the eventual utilization of PCN-101 in home-based therapeutic scenarios.",https://thedalesreport.com/psychedelics/atai-life-sciences-announces-positive-results-from-phase-1-bridging-study-of-pcn-101/,health
70588,09-08-2023 02:14,7723600,United States: Timothy Brown Authors MBA Section Review Article On Legal Protections For Animals - Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith LLP,"Boston Associate Timothy Brown penned an article for the Massachusetts Bar Association on the legal protections for animals, exploring the historical and philosophical perspectives. He highlights the complexities of drafting laws for animals, balancing their potential emotional experiences and personhood with the notion of animals as property. The article traces the evolution of animal protection laws in the U.S. from the 19th century, touching on major legislations such as the National Park Service Organic Act of 1916, The Animal Welfare Act of 1966, and the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Brown's work suggests a growing trend towards stronger legal recognition for animal rights. He is an attorney member of the Animal Legal Defense Fund, specializing in defending corporations in product liability, general liability, and toxic tort and environmental litigation.","Boston, Mass. (August 4, 2023) – Boston Associate Timothy Brown recently authored a Massachusetts Bar Association (MBA) Section Review article on legal protections afforded to animals through a historical and philosophical lens.
In his piece, Mr. Brown addresses challenges pertaining to lawmakers when drafting laws that apply to animals, since one can argue that legislative resources should exclusively focus on humans' basic access to fundamental legal rights across the globe. These laws are also challenging to enact from a practical point of view, because animals are at times property, and therefore owners can have vested interests in how animals are treated and sold for profit.
From a philosophical point of view, there have been theories that animals might be capable of having emotional experiences, and that certain qualities that define personhood should also apply to animals. Certain species of animals might even be capable of introspection, memory, language, and empathy, and therefore may deserve more encompassing legal protections.
In the article, Mr. Brown provides a historical overview of legal protections for animals, and how in the 19th century, early criminal laws protected commercially viable animals such as horses and cattle from harm. The article covers the beginnings of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) committee, and later legislation that was passed that protected the abandonment of ""any living creature.""
The article goes on to highlight other major legislation that has impacted animals, such as the National Park Service Organic Act of 1916, The Animal Welfare Act of 1966, and the Endangered Species Act of 1973. According to Mr. Brown, ""as the legal community has made strides in the last few decades in this area of law, the pathway for greater legal recognition for the protection of animal interests is beginning to develop.""
Mr. Brown is a member of the Products Liability, Toxic Tort & Environmental Litigation, and OSHA Safety and Health Practices. He currently focuses his practice on the defense of corporations, manufacturers, contractors, suppliers, and premises owners in matters involving product liability, general liability, and toxic tort and environmental litigation. He is also an attorney member of the Animal Legal Defense Fund.

70585,09-08-2023 02:13,7723595,Algernon Neuroscience Announces Phase 2 DMT Stroke Study | Microdose,"Algernon Pharmaceuticals' subsidiary, Algernon NeuroScience, is ready to conduct a Phase 2 trial investigating the use of DMT (a psychedelic drug) in treating stroke patients. This follows a successful feasibility study and the completion of the trial design, which will involve 40 patients. The company aims to explore DMT's potential in promoting neuroplasticity in healing brain injuries. Earlier studies have shown that DMT can reduce infarct volume and almost fully restore motor function. The upcoming trial will administer DMT intravenously in sub-psychedelic doses to acute ischemic stroke patients.","For more on Algernon’s DMT work, see Algernon NeuroScience Doses First Subject in Phase 1 DMT Clinical Stroke Study and Wonderland 2022 Recap: Algernon Pharmaceuticals Algernon NeuroScience Announces 40 Patient Phase 2 Psychedelic Drug DMT Stroke Study VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Aug. 08, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Algernon Pharmaceuticals Inc. (the “Company” or “AGN Pharma”) (CSE: AGN) (FRANKFURT: AGW0) (OTCQB: AGNPF), a Canadian clinical stage pharmaceutical development company, is pleased to announce that its subsidiary Algernon NeuroScience (AGN Neuro), has completed a feasibility study and has finalized its clinical trial design for a 40 patient Phase 2 DMT Stroke study. AGN Neuro is the world’s first company to investigate DMT for the treatment of stroke and its ability to promote neuroplasticity in the healing of brain injuries. The Phase 2 human stroke trial will study an intravenous sub-psychedelic dose of DMT in patients who are hospitalized after having suffered an acute ischemic stroke. Algernon consultant Dr. Rick Strassman, DMT research pioneer and author of the books DMT: The Spirit Molecule and The Psychedelic Handbook commented: “I am encouraged by the results of Algernon’s Phase 1 study in which a prolonged infusion of DMT achieved the desired pharmacokinetics. In addition, psychological and physiological responses remain below those associated with psychedelic effects. These data support moving into clinical studies in stroke patients, and I will closely follow the Phase 2 study as it advances.” The decision to investigate DMT for stroke treatment was based on the ground-breaking 2020-published rat occlusion stroke study showing that DMT reduced infarct volume and led to an almost full recovery of motor function 30 days after a single treatment with statistical significance.This was also one of numerous pre-clinical studies that showed DMT increases brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), the main neurotrophin involved in healing the brain after an injury. DMT activates pathways involved in forming neuronal connections and has been shown to increase the capacity of neurons to form new neural connections by expanding cell morphology and the growth of dendritic spines; the sites of signal transduction between neurons. DMT has also been shown to protect at risk tissue from death, a process AGN Neuro plans to capitalize on by providing the drug in the acute period before damage has a chance to substantially expand. “DMT’s ability to promote neuroplasticity, already demonstrated preclinically, combined with its neuroprotective effects make it unique amongst potential therapies being investigated for stroke,” said Dr. David Nutt, Edmund J. Safra Professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London, and Algernon consultant. “The potential benefits of DMT in stroke patients not only at the time of their injury, but also in the post-stroke recovery period, makes Algernon’s upcoming trial very, very exciting.” AGN Neuro is planning to conduct the study at multiple locations in Europe using the Company’s existing finished product supply of intravenous DMT. Ethics submission is planned for later in Q3 with the study starting a short time after approval. Phase 2 Stroke Study Design Subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of ischemic stroke will be randomized in blinded fashion to receive either DMT or placebo. The primary outcome measure of the study will be safety, and information will be gained on measures of efficacy including preservation of brain tissue, motor recovery, depression and numerous biomarkers linked to the pathophysiology of stroke. The decision to advance into a Phase 2 study was based on positive data from the Company’s Phase 1 trial conducted at the Centre for Human Drug Research (CHDR) in Leiden, Netherlands. This study showed that plasma levels of DMT associated with neuroplasticity in preclinical studies could be achieved with a prolonged, 6-hour infusion of AP-188 at a dose which did not cause a psychedelic experience. The amount given exceeded the human equivalent of the dose used in preclinical studies in rats which demonstrated neuroprotective effects. “Our planned Phase 2 stroke study investigating DMT, the first of its kind in the world, is very exciting and we look forward to getting the trial underway as soon as possible,” said Christopher J. Moreau, CEO of Algernon Pharmaceuticals. “We are investigating DMT as a potential new therapeutic treatment that could have a positive impact on ischemic stroke patients worldwide.” About DMT N,N-Dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, is a hallucinogenic tryptamine drug producing effects similar to those of other psychedelics like LSD, ketamine, psilocybin and psilocin. DMT occurs naturally in many plant species and animals including humans and has been used in religious ceremonies as a traditional spiritual medicine by indigenous people in the Amazon basin. DMT can also be synthesised in a laboratory. DMT is an agonist of multiple receptors, including serotonin receptors and the sigma-1 receptor. Sigma-1 is a multi-faceted stress-responsive receptor which promotes cell survival, neuroprotection, neuroplasticity, and neuroimmunomodulation. Further, DMT promotes the release of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a protein which can aid in recovery after a brain injury. DMT has a rapid onset, intense psychedelic effects, and a relatively short duration of action at high doses. At sub-hallucinogenic doses, DMT has been shown to induce and improve structural and functional neuroplasticity in preclinical murine models. Algernon has filed patents for DMT pamoate and nicotinate (novel salt forms of DMT), in addition to formulation, dosage and method of use claims for ischemic stroke and TBI. The Company has also filed claims for combination therapy of DMT and stroke rehabilitation including Constraint Induced Movement Therapy.

Originally developed by the NSA in 2015, SharkSeer uses multiple systems to detect and block malicious network traffic. It serves as a boundary cyber defense tool for the Department of Defense Information Network, generating unique threat data to enable other platforms to mitigate threats. DISA plans to further develop the systems by transitioning to a zero-trust framework, adding multifactor authentication, and using more cloud-based security tools. Parsons, which was involved in the original design and implementation of SharkSeer, received a task order in 2020 to further improve the program.","The Defense Information Systems Agency has assumed responsibility for the management and operations of a cyber defense tool previously managed by the National Security Agency. SharkSeer is a system of government, commercial and open-source systems designed to detect and block malicious network traffic through the use of automated and blocking mechanisms, DISA said Monday. In 2015, NSA developed the SharkSeer program as an adaptive platform to rapidly integrate new technologies. The system serves as a boundary cyber defense tool to help ensure the security of the Department of Defense Information Network and generates unique threat data content to enable other defensive platforms to mitigate threats. NSA officially handed over the program to DISA in late June and celebrated the final transition on July 20 in Annapolis Junction, Maryland. “Geographically deploying the SHARKSEER capability at the 10 DISA-managed internet access points to monitor traffic provides an unprecedented level of visibility to the warfighter supporting the DOD cyber network defense incident response mission,” said Alexis Grayson, SharkSeer program manager at DISA. Grayson said DISA will further develop the systems by transitioning to a zero-trust framework, adding multifactor authentication capability and using more cloud-based security tools. Parsons was involved in the SharkSeer program’s original design and implementation.
